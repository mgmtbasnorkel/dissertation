The Spark Campaign : This campaign uses social engineering to infect victims, mainly from the Palestinian territories, with the Spark backdoor . This backdoor first emerged in January 2019 and has been continuously active since then. The campaign’s lure content revolves around recent geopolitical events, espeically the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, and the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Fatah Palestinian movements. The Pierogi Campaign : This campaign uses social engineering attacks to infect victims with a new, undocumented backdoor dubbed Pierogi . This backdoor first emerged in December 2019, and was discovered by Cybereason. In this campaign, the attackers use different TTPs and decoy documents reminiscent of previous campaigns by MoleRATs involving the Micropsia and Kaperagent malware. In part one of this research, we analyze the Spark campaign. This campaign is named after a rare backdoor used by the MoleRATs Group, dubbed Spark by Cybereason and previously reported by 360’s blog . For a detailed report on the Pierogi campaign, please see part 2 of this research. The creators of the Spark backdoor use several techniques to evade detection and stay under the radar. They pack the malware with a powerful commercial tool called Enigma Packer and implement language checks to ensure the victims are Arabic speaking. This minimizes the risk of detection and infection of unwanted victims.

Chain of Compromise The main page previously hosted at “www.president-office.gov.mm” was powered by Drupal, which loaded several Javascript files that applied a Drupal theme. One of these Javascript files loaded by the main page, named “script.js” and seen in Figure 1, was responsible for several of the website’s features, including the cycling slides of content on the main page. Figure 1. External JavaScript Used to Load Drupal Theme The “script.js” file also contained an IFRAME (Figure 2), which Unit 42 believes threat actors injected to exploit the browsers of visitors to the website. We analyzed the content in “script.js”, as well as the HTTP response received from the web server. One interesting thing to note is that the web server, specifically Drupal version 7, used HTTP responses that contain the “Last-Modified” field for caching purposes. We checked the response for the “script.js” file that contained the injected IFRAME and found a “Last-Modified” date of “Wed, 24 Dec 2014 02:38:58 GMT”, which may suggest that the threat actor injected the IFRAME on December 24, 2014. Figure 2.

Despite the media attention, details were sparse regarding the extent and aftermath of the crisis. Reports surfaced of attempts at escape and defection to neighboring China, after border forces and fencing were washed away. Drawing even more curiosity were statements from Pyongyang itself, which took the rare step of publicly declaring the flood the worst natural disaster since 1945.

In various cases, the operators exchanged numerous messages with their victims for weeks before sending their malicious documents. The emails were efficient social-engineering attempts that appealed to a vast number of human emotions (fear, stress, anger, etc.) to elicit a response from their victims. One of the domains used by the attackers in their 2018 campaign of spear phishing contained more than 130 email aliases, leading us to think that more than 130 companies had been targeted by the end of 2018. Malicious Documents We have seen two types of documents sent to victims in these spear phishing campaigns. The first one exploits the INCLUDEPICTURE feature of Microsoft Word to get context information about the victim’s computer, and the availability and version number of Microsoft Word. The second one, which in many cases is an Office document protected with a trivial password, such as “12345”, “1234”, etc., uses macros to execute a GRIFFON implant on the target’s computer. In various cases, the associated macro also scheduled tasks to make GRIFFON persistent.

These attacks involve adding a new piece of JavaScript to the infected sites with an innocuous looking name, for example “jquery-min.js”. The filename used varied between different compromised sites.

The convoluted infection methodology MegaCortex employs leverages both automated and manual components, and appears to involve a high amount of automation to infect a greater number of victims. In attacks we’ve investigated, the attackers used a common red-team attack tool script to invoke a meterpreter reverse shell in the victim’s environment.

Given the fact that Buhtrap and RTM have been used in the past to target accounting departments, we immediately believed that a similar strategy was at play. But how were potential victims directed to the website? Infection campaigns At least some of the potential victims who ended up on this website were lured there through malvertising. Below you can see an example of a redirect URL to the malicious website: https://blanki-shabloni24.ru/?utm_source=yandex&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=cid|{ blanki_rsya }|context&utm_content=gid|3590756360|aid|6683792549|15114654950_&utm_term= скачать бланк счета &pm_source= bb.f2.kz &pm_block=none&pm_position=0&yclid=1029648968001296456 We can see in the URL that a banner ad was posted on bb.f2[.]kz, which is a legitimate accounting forum. It is important to note here that these banners appeared on several different websites, all with the same campaign id (blanki_rsya) and most of them related to accounting or legal aid services. From the URL, we can also see what the user was searching for – “скачать бланк счета” or “download invoice template” – reinforcing our hypothesis that organizations are targeted. A list of the websites where the banners and the related search term appeared is shown in Table 1.

Search terms used and domains where the banners were displayed The blanki-shabloni24[.]ru website was probably set up in this way to survive basic scrutiny. An ad pointing to a professional-looking website with a link to GitHub is not something obviously bad. Moreover, the cybercriminals put the malicious files on their GitHub repository only for a limited period of time, probably while the ad campaign was active. Most of the time, the payload on GitHub was an empty zip file or a clean executable. To summarize, the cybercriminals were able to distribute ads through the Yandex.Direct service to websites that were likely to be visited by accountants searching for specific terms. Let’s now take a look at the different payloads that were distributed this way. Payload Analysis Distribution timeline This malware campaign started in late October 2018 and is still active at time of writing. Since the whole repository was publicly available on GitHub, we were able to draw a precise timeline of the malware families distributed (see Figure 2).

289,Long_Train,"heap memory, another hardcoded offset, specific to the executable, is used to start the backdoor. The offset points to a position-independent shellcode-style function that unwraps and runs the malicious code further. Some of the older samples revealed the project path via a PDB file reference: “ D:\C++\AsusShellCode\Release\AsusShellCode.pdb “. This suggests that the attackers had exclusively prepared the malicious payload for their target. A similar tactic of precise targeting has become a persistent property of these attackers. A look at the resource section used for carrying the malicious payload revealed that the attackers had decided not to change the file size of the ASUS Live Updater binary. They changed the resource contents and overwrote a tiny block of the code in the subject executable. The layout of that patched file is shown below. We managed to find the original ASUS Live Updater executable which had been patched and abused by the attackers. As a result, we were able to recover the overwritten data in the resource section. The file we found was digitally signed and certainly had no infection present. Both the legitimate ASUS executable and the resource-embedded updater binary contain timestamps from March 2015. Considering that the operation took place in 2018, this raises the following question: why did the attackers choose an old ASUS binary as the infection carrier? Another injection technique was found in more recent samples. Using that technique, the attackers patched the code inside the C runtime (CRT) library function “___crtExitProcess”. The malicious code executes a shellcode loader instead of the standard function “___crtCorExitProcess”: This way, the execution flow is passed to another address which is located at the end of the code section. The attackers used a small decryption routine that can fit into a block at the end of the code section, which has a series of zero bytes in the original executable. They used the same source executable file from ASUS (compiled in March 2015) for this new type of injection. The loader code copies another block of encrypted shellcode from the file’s resource section (of the type “EXE”) to a newly allocated memory block with read-write-execute attributes and decrypts it using a custom block-chaining XOR algorithm, where the first dword is the initial seed and the total size of the shellcode is stored at an offset of +8. We believe that the attackers changed the payload start routine in an attempt to evade detection. Apparently, they switched to a better method of hiding their embedded shellcode at some point between the end of July and September 2018. ShadowHammer downloader The compromised ASUS binaries carried a payload that was a Trojan downloader. Let us take a closer look at one such ShadowHammer downloader extracted from a copy of the ASUS Live Updater tool with MD5:0f49621b06f2cdaac8850c6e9581a594.

The campaign The malware's primary infection vector is SMS. Just like the old-school mail worms that used the victim's address book to select the next victims, this banking trojan's activation cycle includes the exfiltration of the victim's address book. The trojan will receive instructions from the C2 to spread. Spread command from C2 The victim receives the command sendSMSMass. Usually, this message targets four or five people at a time. The body contains a message and URL. Again, the concept is that new victims are more likely to install the malware if the SMS comes from someone they know. When a victim tries to access the URL in the SMS body, the C2 will check if the mobile device meets the criteria to receive the malware (see infrastructure section). If the device does not meet the criteria, it won't receive any data, otherwise, it will be redirected to a second server to receive a copy of the malware to install on their device. The domain on this campaign was registered on Jan. 19, 2019. However, Talos has identified that was used at least since November 2018. During the investigation, Talos was also able to determine that the same infrastructure has been used to deploy similar campaigns using different versions of the malware. Distribution of victims.

Very few reports offer follow-ups to what transpires after an attacker is completely pushed out of an environment. If they did, those reports would most likely paint a much bleaker picture of the cyberthreat landscape. The truth is most companies are never aware they’ve been breached again, even if they are hit multiple times after the initial attack. The truth is that intelligent attackers with long-term surveillance goals do not simply give up after their malware and command and control (C2) infrastructure is burned. Attackers typically redesign C2 infrastructure and deploy entirely new or updated malware after being exposed. Unless companies are well positioned to detect these changes, attackers will quietly slip back in time and time again.

On the other hand, normal threat actors might not have the ability or resources to plan sophisticated campaigns and their tools are more generic in nature and are often available in underground markets . However, we recently came across evidence of a large-scale cybercrime activity that appears to combine targeted attack tools and regular cybercrime: The attackers distribute typical malware such as cryptocurrency miners and ransomware by making use of sophisticated tools that were previously mostly seen in targeted attacks. In the cases we identified, the threat actors were using a package of tools from the Equation group (which was publicly leaked by the Shadow Brokers) to compromise a large number of machines running outdated versions of Microsoft Windows OS.",0

This fake invoice acts as a decoy document to minimize the user’s suspicions that any malicious activity occurred. Figure 2 Decoy document opened to minimize suspicions of compromise While the macro displays the decoy invoice spreadsheet, it silently runs malicious code in the background to install its payload. The malicious code starts by concatenating several base64 encoded strings into a single variable. As you can see in the following code snippet, the variable name “Paltofp1” suggests that the author of this code may want our attention: The macro then writes the concatenated base64 encoded data to the file %PUBLIC%\Libraries\B642.txt. It then reads in the “B642.txt” file and decodes the data, which it will save to the file %PUBLIC%\Libraries\servicereset.exe (SHA256: 52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9). The servicereset.exe file is the payload of this attack, which is a variant of ISMDoor that we track as ISMAgent. The script then creates a file named %PUBLIC%\Libraries\OfficeServicesStatus.vbs which contains a VBScript that will execute the “servicereset.exe” file using the command line. Lastly, as a persistence mechanism, a scheduled task named “OfficeServicesStatus” will be created, set to run every three minutes, as seen in Figure 3. Figure 3 Scheduled task created by the macro within the delivery document An Iterative Task While hunting for other samples similar to the one observed in the attack against the technology organization, we discovered yet another variant of Clayslide (SHA256: 5ac939a5426db8614165bd8b6a02d3e8d9f167379c6ed28025bf3b37f1aea902). This sample was dated June 2017, a month older than the newest version containing ISMAgent. Based upon timestamping and similarities with both the original Clayslide documents as well as the newest ISMAgent loaded ones, we believe this June 2016 sample to be an iterative version of Clayslide. The June 2017 sample of Clayslide contained the same OfficeServicesStatus.vbs file found in the ISMAgent Clayslide document, but instead of having the payload embedded in the macro as segregated base64 strings that would be concatenated, this variant obtained its payload from multiple cells within the “Incompatible” worksheet.

We’ll discuss here the similarities observed between the various components used to exploit these two vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on the malicious Flash files and the payloads delivered. Malicious Flash Files Recent zero-day vulnerabilities exploited by UPS exploit or leverage Adobe Flash to exploit other applications on the system. Unit 42 recently analyzed malicious Flash files that exploited CVE-2015-3113 , which was a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash that was patched on June 23, 2015. . During the analysis, we noticed similarities between this malicious Flash file, those that UPS used to exploit CVE-2014-1776, and the proof-of-concept code for CVE-2014-6332 , albeit these two Flash files were used to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. Overlaps within ActionScript Unit 42 analyzed the ActionScript within malicious Flash files created by UPS that exploited CVE-2014-1776 and CVE-2015-3113 and discovered shared code between the two. First, both ActionScripts contain a function named “hexToIntArray”, which Figure 1 displays side-by-side for comparison. Not only do these files contain the same function name, but they also share the same exact operation codes (opcodes) to carry out its functionality. The existence of the hexToIntArray function in the CVE-2015-3113 sample is rather interesting, as it is never called or used within the ActionScript. We believe that the threat actor used the CVE-2014-1776 ActionScript as the basis for",0

Two Styles of Bartalex Bartalex has two main mechanisms used to deploy the second-stage payload onto the victim’s machine. Let’s look at both: → Downloader / Loader These samples will issue an HTTP GET Request for a remote object. This remote object is the secondary payload usually being hosted on a compromised system. The subsequent infection vector will either be presented as-is (Win32 form) or encoded in some way. Dridex campaigns routinely use the loader method and will download the second-stage in its native form. CryptoWall (ransomware) campaigns will also use the loader technique, however, with a little twist. The second-stage payload in a CryptoWall campaign is usually obfuscated via a XOR cipher (most",0
301,Long_Train,"the malware is represented in the following diagram: As this malware uses a multistage execution flow, we’ll discuss each stage individually. Initial Exploitation The sample of T9000 used in this analysis was originally dropped via a RTF file that contained exploits for both CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 . When triggered, an initial shellcode stage is run, which is responsible for locating and executing a secondary shellcode stub. The second stage shellcode reads the initial RTF document and seeks to the end of the file, using the last four bytes as the size of the embedded payload. With the payload size confirmed, the shellcode will create a file in the %TEMP% folder using a temporary filename. The shellcode will decrypt and subsequently load the embedded payload in the RTF file. The decrypted payload is written to the temporary file and executed using WinExec. The shellcode then attempts to decrypt an embedded decoy document with the same algorithm used to decrypt the payload, which it will save to %TEMP%\~tmp.doc path. This file is opened using the following command: cmd /C %TEMP%\~tmp.doc However, this particular sample did not contain a decoy document. Stage 1 When this temporary file is initially executed, it will begin by creating the following mutex to ensure only one instance of the malware is running at a given time: 820C90CxxA1B084495866C6D95B2595xx1C3 It continues to perform a number of checks for installed security products on the victim machine.

Plugged in for malware One of the interesting features of NSIS installers is their plug-in architecture, which allow installers to communicate with other software components—including components of the Windows operating system. (A list of available plug-ins can be found here .) These plug-ins are deployed as Windows DLL files. If selected during the installer build, they will be automatically added to the final compiled NSIS installer’s packaged files inside the “$PLUGINS” folder. Some of the capabilities these plugins can provide include: Killing processes Executing Command Line based programs Dynamically decompressing files Loading a DLL and calling to its exports The installers we looked at caught our attention because they all drop the same set of “junk files” (files that are never used by the installed malware) across the initial sample set. We’ve seen the tactic of packing NSIS installers with garbage files to conceal malware in the past; the junk files are intended to confuse analysts and create “noise” during sandbox analysis. So this behavior caught our attention, and we started to analyze it in more detail. We found that all the samples use the System.dll plugin, which allows you to load a DLL and call its exported functions. The DLL called by these malicious installers injects a payload into memory (in most cases by using cmd.exe ). For purposes of illustration, this report focuses primarily on the analysis of one sample NSIS installer from the first group we discovered: The output of the Exeinfo PE tool identifies the sample as an NSIS installer NSIS installers contain compressed components, including executable code, which can be loaded into memory by the installers.

Shellbot is known since 2005 and even available on GitHub. Now, Shellbot has re-appeared in the threat landscape in a recent campaign, targeting organizations worldwide with a new IRC server and new Monero pools, so we decided to deepen the analysis. Based on our findings, there are some similarities in both techniques and architectures with another cybercrime group, which appeared in the wild around 2012, most probably Romanian. Technical Analysis As previously mentioned, the infection chain starts with the hack of a Linux server, after a SSH brute-force attack as shown in Fig.1. The Access Logs include requests coming from different source IP addresses with a delay of about 30 seconds from each other. Using this trick, the bruteforce is able to bypass lockout login mechanisms such as Fail2Ban. Once the machine is fully compromised, the attacker will install a complete hacking suite, composed of an IRC bot, an SSH scanner, a bruteforce tool, and an XMRIG crypto-miner. All the malicious logic is opportunely managed by several bash or perl scripts. Figure 1: Shellbot Bruteforcing When the machine is",1

Our research revealed that some of these applications send data back to a host server, or are controlled in some way from IP addresses located in Iran, even if the devices are located outside the country. Another method we saw in the Iranian attacks was the creation of fake login pages. Even though this isn't an advanced technique, it is effective against users who aren't as aware of cybersecurity as they should be. Iran-connected groups like ""Charming Kitten"" have been using this technique for a while targeting secure messaging apps. Some actors are also hijacking the device's BGP protocol. This technique redirects the traffic of all routers, without the device considering the original of those new routes. In order to hijack BGP, there needs to be some sort of cooperation from an internet service provider (ISP), and is easily detectable, so the new routes won't be in place for very long. Talos hasn't found a solid connection between the several attacks we've observed, but all of them target Iran and their nationals and the Telegram app. Although this post focuses on Iran, mobile users across the globe still need to be aware that these techniques could be used by any threat actor in any country, state-sponsored or not. This is especially prevalent in countries like Iran and Russia, where apps like Telegram are banned, and developers create clones that appear on official and unofficial app stores to replicate Telegram's services. A regular user can't do anything about the BGP hijacking, but using legitimate applications from the official application stores reduces the risk. This same rule applies to the cloned applications, installing applications from untrusted sources implies a certain degree of risk that the users must be aware of. In both situations, this risk is substantially increased when the applications are unofficial ""enhanced functionality"" applications, even when they are available on the official Google Play store.

This report documents two phishing campaigns that Amnesty International believes are being carried out by the same attacker (or attackers) likely originating from amongst the Gulf countries. These broad campaigns have targeted hundreds, if not a thousand, HRDs, journalists, political actors and others in many countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa region. What makes these campaigns especially troubling is the lengths to which they go to subvert the digital security strategies of their targets. The first campaign, for example, utilizes especially well-crafted fake websites meant to imitate well-known “secure email” providers. Even more worryingly, the second demonstrates how attackers can easily defeat some forms of two-factor authentication to steal credentials, and obtain and maintain access to victims’ accounts. As a matter of fact, Amnesty Tech’s continuous monitoring and investigations into campaigns of targeted surveillance against HRDs suggest that many attacker groups are developing this capability. Taken together, these campaigns are a reminder that phishing is a pressing threat and that more awareness and clarity over appropriate countermeasures needs to be available to human rights defenders. Phishing Sites Imitating “Secure Email” Providers Amnesty International has identified several well-crafted phishing sites for the popular email services Tutanota and ProtonMail . The providers are marketed as “secure email” solutions and have consequently gained some traction among activists. These sites contain several elements that make them especially difficult for targets to identify as fakes. For instance, the attackers managed to obtain the domain tutanota.org and used it to almost completely replicate the original website for the Tutanota service, which is actually located at tutanota.com .

The majority of delivery documents contain a generic lure image requesting the victim enable macros with no additional content, the adversaries seemingly relying solely on lure filenames to entice victims to launch the malicious document. In all, we intercepted nine weaponized documents spanning from October 17, 2018 through November 15, 2018 all sharing the same Joohn author name and delivering variants of either Zebrocy or Cannon. The target radius of our dataset spans four continents, covering government agencies at the federal level all the way to local government agencies. We also conducted timeline analysis using the collected data which allowed us to discover how the Sofacy group timed their attacks in the Dear Joohn campaign and also how they may have crafted their attacks using automated tools. Attack Details Beginning on October 17, 2018, we collected a total of nine delivery documents sent to a multitude of organizations around the world. The targets included a foreign affairs organization in North America, foreign affairs organizations in Europe, as well as government entities in former USSR states.

One of the malware's most interesting features is that it reads Windows’ ntdll.dll module from disk into memory, and calls its exported functions directly, rendering user-mode hooking and API monitoring mechanisms ineffective. The malware author calls this technique ""Lagos Island method"" (allegedly originating from a userland rootkit with this name). It also features a persistence method that randomly changes the path, filename, file extension, and the registry key used for persistence. The malware author does not sell the builder, but only sells the panel, and then generates the executable files as a service.

375,Long_Train,"one. Solutions like device binding and fingerprinting allowed financials to detect such techniques, therefore criminals had to innovate again. In this situation RATs are criminals’ Holy Grail, as they offer the ability to perform fraudulent transactions directly from the infected (victim) device. By doing so, criminals are making it substantially harder to detect fraudulent transactions without a client-based detection solution. In Android banking malware, the RAT capability has not been commonly used due to limitations of the Android operating system (it requires use of the Accessibility Service). Nevertheless, back in 2016 the “Retefe” threat actors were already observed making use of RAT functionality by abusing the TeamViewer application, giving them full control over the infected device. As Retefe is run by a group of experienced Windows malware actors and because RAT capabilities are quite common in Windows banking malware, the actors probably decided to reuse that approach with Android devices as well. Threat actors motivated by financial gain have noticed the shift of consumers from desktop towards mobile based online banking. This trend has also resulted in the evolution of mobile malware in order to bypass detection measures. From simple SMS-stealer to fully-fledged RAT with Automated Transaction Systems, criminals continuously innovate to try to remain successful. Hereafter is an overview of recent changes made by some key players in the Android banking malware threat landscape. Cerberus The Cerberus banking Trojan that appeared on the threat landscape end of June 2019 has taken over from the infamous Anubis Trojan as major rented banking malware. While offering a feature-set that enables successful exfiltration of personally identifiable information (PII) from infected devices, Cerberus was still lacking features that could help lowering the detection barrier during the abuse of stolen information and fraud. Mid-January 2020, after new-year celebrations, Cerberus authors came back with a new variant that aimed to resolve that problem, a RAT feature to perform fraud from the infected device. This new Cerberus variant has undergone refactoring of the code base and updates of the C2 communication protocol, but most notably it got enhanced with the RAT capability, possibility to steal device screen-lock credentials (PIN code or swipe pattern) and 2FA tokens from the Google Authenticator application. The RAT service is able to traverse the file system",1

Figure 5: Timeline showing evolution of Nemucod weaponized documents. Common throughout all versions of the weaponized document droppers is password-protected VBA code, as shown in Figure 6 below. The attackers use this to hinder researcher analysis and perhaps to give the document more legitimacy for those people, or security solutions, looking at such properties. Figure 6: Password-protected VBA editor to protect code Also common to all versions is the use of a heavily obfuscated JScript payload, an excerpt of which is shown in Figure 7. The obfuscation makes use of variable names that are seemingly randomly generated, extensive use of Unicode character encoding (e.g. \u00xx) where xx is the ASCII character code representation, and the use of generally unnecessary arithmetic to piece together sub-strings or select characters from strings. Such obfuscation is primarily to avoid signature-based detection technologies but has little to no effect on dynamic analysis sandbox systems, such as Wildfire.

Figure 1 Flowchart describing the testing process carried out by OilRig actor Lucky for us, the threat actors do not modify the metadata within their delivery documents, which allows us to determine when the actor last modified each Word document. These untainted timestamps allow us to create a timeline that we can use to order the files as they were created by the actor. Our analysis methodology involves iteratively comparing each file with the next file in the timeline to determine the changes the actor made to the first file that resulted in the creation of the second file. The first testing activity we observed began with an initial sample created on June 13, 2016 with 17 subsequent files created for testing purposes that the actor created in a two-hour period on June 15, 2016. Table 1shows the samples we observed associated with the June 2016 testing activity, including the iteration, the last modified timestamp, the hash, the filename, and the antivirus detection rate of the newly created file. The first “ttt.xls” file and the files with incrementing filenames have the same decoy contents, which is the reason we initially included this sample with this group despite the difference in naming.

The RC5 key is constructed using the volume serial number of the C drive. The volume serial number is a 4-byte value, usually based on the install time of the system. The volume serial number is XORed with the hard-coded constant “ [email protected] !rCto R$.” and then converted to hex to derive a key of up to 28 bytes in length. The key length can vary if the XORed value contains an embedded zero byte because the lstrlenA API call is used to determine the length of it.

Fake invoice reminder stating that a payment is due the day after tomorrow and that the payment may take up to 72 hours to be processed. One of the defining characteristics of Guildma’s distribution chains is using tools already present on the system, often in new and unusual ways. Another characteristic is reusing techniques.

Most importantly, there was no change to the encoding key (now using offset 20, and offset 11 for second pass against URL encoding) that we had observed being used for the entire decade-long campaign, and documented in our previous blog. From this we conclude that the attackers were unaware of our initial report. Sinkhole Through cooperation with the parties responsible for the C2 domains, we took control of all but one of them, transferring the A records to a server we controlled. This prevented the attackers from being able to subsequently make any further changes to the domain configurations, issue commands to victims, or capture any further data for the majority of victims.

Talos has previously documented one such actor, ""Panda,"" illustrating their potential for long-term exploitation of their victims' resources and their resilience from being deterred from future action. These attributes make Vivin, and other actors like them, legitimate risks to organizational resource abuse and potential data theft. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Vivin expose the actor's campaigns to multiple potential points of mitigation. Some of these include good systems hygiene such as preventing the use of pirated software on endpoints, proper event logging and monitoring, and systems resource monitoring. Other mitigation strategies involve a more active defense. For example, blocking the URIs used by the mining pools and the malware's intermediate stages. Detection signatures can also prevent the XMRig miner from being dropped and executed on targeted hosts. What's new? This is yet another reminder that malicious crypto mining still has a major spot on the threat landscape and, judging by this actor, are successful and long standing campaigns.

References to those trojanized files date back to stack overflow posts from October 2017. Once all the malicious files are downloaded, the threat actor gained full control over the web server - allowing them to add an administrative account, recover the web admin’s email account and WordPress password hash. If the password was recovered, from the hash and was used for multiple accounts, it could allow access to corporate resources. In most cases we assess that the web servers ultimately became part of the Propeller Ads advertising network. Additional research shows that the Propeller Ads network has been associated with a plethora of malicious activity from different threat actors, including but not limited to malvertising and the Fallout exploit kit . This ad network is manipulated by attackers to become the contagion vector, allowing threat actors to remotely post malicious ads on otherwise benign websites. The malicious ads run javascript files, and surreptitiously install malware on victimized machines.

As new Magecart groups materialized with unique code and tactics, we built on our Magecart base knowledge to get better and better at detecting Magecart and other forms of web skimming. In this article, we will discuss our insights into a criminal group that maximizes their profit by working in two ecosystems that are typically distinct: phishing and web skimming. By leveraging a tactic with which they had tons of experience, phishing, they could double-dip into one with which they had less expertise, web skimming. By combining tactics, this group was playing with a full deck when it came to stealing financial data—introducing Full(z) House. Here, Malwarebytes published an article highlighting a small piece of this group's activity in card skimming.

Researchers have since blogged on its use of the Golang programming language and the new backdoor, Godlua . There is an operational blog mapping Rocke operations to the MITRE ATT&CK framework . Unit 42 has also published blogs on the group’s Xbash ransomware tool and its cloud security evasion and cryptomining techniques . Rocke was initially associated with ransomware campaigns through the use of its Linux-focused Xbash tool, a data-destruction malware similar in functionality to NotPetya . NotPetya used the EternalBlue exploit to propagate across a network. Xbash performed lateral movement by leveraging an organization’s unpatched vulnerabilities and use of weak passwords, which potentially limited its overall effectiveness. When Rocke compromised an organization, it demanded that victims pay 0.2, 0.15, or 0.02 bitcoin (BTC) to restore lost data. However, Rocke was unable to restore any data since Xbash deleted database tables prior to demanding the ransom.

Although these steps appear to be relatively static within the loader, there are slight differences we were able to identify based on the time of deployment. One such case is a sample that appears to have been used for testing at least 6 months before the majority of samples were seen in the wild.

During the incident, some SIS controllers entered a failed safe state, which automatically shutdown the industrial process and prompted the asset owner to initiate an investigation. The investigation found that the SIS controllers initiated a safe shutdown when application code between redundant processing units failed a validation check -- resulting in an MP diagnostic failure message. We assess with moderate confidence that the attacker inadvertently shutdown operations while developing the ability to cause physical damage for the following reasons: Modifying the SIS could prevent it from functioning correctly, increasing the likelihood of a failure that would result in physical consequences. TRITON was used to modify application memory on SIS controllers in the environment, which could have led to a failed validation check.

The group leveraged spear phishing campaigns and malicious documents the contents of which included very specific language suggesting that they were crafted by native Korean speakers rather than through the use of translation services. The actor has the following demonstrated capabilities: To include exploits (for Hangul and Microsoft Office) in its workflows. To modify its campaigns by splitting the payload in to multiple stages To use compromised web servers or legitimate cloud based platforms. To use HTTPS communications to make it harder to perform traffic analysis. To compromise third parties to forge realistic spear phishing campaigns (i.e. Yonsei university in the ""Golden Time"" campaign). To constantly evolve, the new fileless capability included in 2018 is a proof. The Timeline Here is the timeline for 2017 and the beginning of 2018: August 2016 to March 2017: ""Golden Time"" Campaign As with the majority of Group 123 campaigns, the initial attack vector during this campaign was spear phishing. Talos identified two different kinds of emails. The first email we discovered was the most interesting. In this sample, we observed the attackers praising the user for joining a panel related to the ""Korean Reunification and North Korean Conference"". The text in the email explained that the recipient should complete the attached document to provide necessary feedback. This appears to be a non-existent conference. The closest match we identified related to any Unification conference was held in January 2017, which was the NYDA Reunification conference. The sender was 'kgf2016@yonsei.ac.kr' which is the contact email of the Korea Global Forum, a separate conference. When we analyzed the email headers, we determined that the email was sent from an SMTP server using an IP associated with the Yonsei University network. We believe that the email address was compromised and abused by the attackers to send the email used in this campaign. The filename for the malicious attachment translates as 'Unification North Korea Conference _ Examination Documents' which reinforces the text in the email about the reunification conference. For an added bonus, in the body of the email, the attacker even suggests that people who completed the document would get paid a 'small fee'. Perhaps the gift of embedded malware is the payment: Much less effort was used to craft the second email Talos analyzed. The email was from a free Korean mail service provided by Daum, Hanmail, indicating that",1

We observed an elevation in the sophistication of social engineering methods employed by the group. In the context of this campaign the attackers impersonated an academic researcher and an officer from the US State Department . Feigning an on-going correspondence, the attackers addressed the target and sent him an acrobat pdf file presenting a letter signed by the US official, containing the phishing link. Once the target fills his credentials, the attackers check if the account can be accessed without 2FA. If unsuccessful, the target will be directed to another phishing page dedicated to steal two-factor identification. Once the attackers gained the email credentials, they immediately changed the email account’s passwords, resulting in the target losing access to their email. TTPs Emails This attack is committed in two steps. First, the attackers create a fake correspondence between two emails they got control of , with the malicious file attached, then they share the “alleged” correspondence with the target. Phase one: Figure A : the first email address allegedly belongs to a leading officer in the US Department of State (fake email address). Figure B : the second email address is associated with an Israeli academic researcher. This address is fake as well and was used in previous attacks by the group. In the initial email, actually sent among themselves, the attackers create the false pretense of a legitimate correspondence to gain the target's trust. In the fake correspondence The “US official” mentions attending a convention at a research institute and meeting the researcher and discussing the subject of the email. As part of the email thread, the alleged US official attached a password protected acrobat pdf file, with the password being the last four digits of the researcher’s phone number. In the following email, the researcher shares the correspondence with the target and relays details from his research and attach the pdf file. The researcher requests the target’s discretion several times to avoid “exposing the information”. The target is sent two “essential” files: Pdf file, allegedly sent by the US official to the researcher. An Excel file containing details of dozens of Baha’is personal details. We learned that the target submitted its login credentials and the attackers succeeded in this attack. After filling his credentials, the target received two emails with alerts about connection attempts from the following IP address (which was located by Google in Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates): 95.216.230[.]247 As part of the camouflage, the attackers feigned innocence and requested the target to try inputting his credentials for a second time, only at this point the link directed to a fake 2FA page. Excel File The attackers attached an Excel sheet listing 51 Baha’is from around the globe that have connections to Iran, Israel, or the US. The table has several columns, detailing academic degrees, first names, surnames, religion (Baha’i, repeated throughout the table), Israeli\Central Asian\foreign citizenships, academic and non-academic associations, and related academic institutes.

Following the recent post [1] published by CERTFA Labs and Raphael Satter’s article in Reuters website [2] , we uncovered additional domains, hostnames and an IP address that are apparently related to the group’s activities. Other than pDNS correlation, as described in the post, the indicators we identified redirect to the official Microsoft website - Microsoft OWA, a mechanism that fits Charming Kitten Modus Operandi and can be seen via URLscan. The domain names mostly consist of a number of words spaced with hyphens and the words ‘service’, ‘check’, ‘recovery’, and ‘activity’. Most of them have the 'site' or 'info' TLD.

They appear to have been copied in a ZIP file named recy.zip . Execution flow The sample analysed uses AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) with a custom DLL named libcef.dll , usually a genuine part of the AIM software. The file pastime.dat is XOR encoded on disk and contains stage 1 shellcode, stage 2 shellcode and the Red Leaves implant DLL. The implant is loaded like so: aim.exe starts and loads libcef.dll . AIM calls a modified function named cef_string_utf16_set . The function cef_string_utf16_set loads pastime.dat and decodes it. The stage 1 shellcode is called. This launches svchost.exe and uses process hollowing to copy the stage 2 shellcode. The stage 2 shellcode allocates further memory inside svchost.exe and loads the Red Leaves implant DLL. The DLL is now running and AIM (the parent process) ends. Timeline The earliest known times obtained by NCC Group are shown below. Note that PE timestamps can be trivially altered.

These samples delivered an updated version of the IsSpace malware family, which was discussed previously in a watering hole attack targeting an aerospace firm . IsSpace is an evolved variant of the NFlog backdoor, which has been used by DragonOK in the past. Figure 1 Taiwanese decoy document Two other samples were identified that used a Tibet-themed decoy document. The document in question (Figure 2) appears to be an internal newsletter from the Central Tibetan Ministry , as suggested by the logo used as well as the content of the document itself. This document indicates that the malware may have been targeted towards an individual that is interested in Tibetan affairs. These particular samples were unique in that they delivered the TidePool malware family that we reported on in May of 2016 . We have not previously observed DragonOK using TidePool in attacks. Figure 2 Tibetan decoy document containing internal newsletter We also identified an additional sample using decoy targeting Taiwanese victims (Figure 3), which deployed a newer sysget sample. Figure 3 Taiwanese-targeted decoy document Other new samples associated with this group used a Russian language decoy document (Figure 4.) The decoy document in question discusses the GOST block cipher, which was created by the Russian government in the 1970’s. The combination of Russian language and Russian-specific subject matter indicates that the intended victim speaks Russian and may be interested in encryption. Like the previously discussed Tibetan decoy documents, these samples also delivered the TidePool malware family.

When he became aware of the attack Rasul immediately feared that the Azerbaijani security services could be behind it. Given his background, this is understandable. In April 2015, Rasul was sentenced to six and a half years in prison, on politically-motivated charges stemming from his work exposing human rights abuses in Azerbaijan in the run up to the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest in the country. Amnesty International considered him a prisoner of conscience and demanded his immediate and unconditional release. The European Court of Human Rights also found that his detention was in violation of human rights law. He was ultimately pardoned after serving more than a year and a half in prison. Rasul’s experience of being impersonated was not unique. Azerbaijani activists and human rights defenders who spoke to Amnesty International cited other instances in which they had been impersonated, or had their accounts compromised. Leyla Yunus , who is also a former prisoner of conscience, and who was also impersonated as part of the malware campaign, recalled that many times over the years, especially in the run-up to her imprisonment in July 2014, several of her online accounts had been compromised. Sometimes this involved fake Facebook accounts impersonating her and fake email addresses which were similar to hers with minor spelling changes. Her personal Facebook account was also taken over several times over the course of this period, and she felt she had no choice but to delete the account. Leyla and Arif Yunus. Elshan Hasanov, a human rights activist working on cases of politically-motivated prosecution, also told Amnesty that his Facebook account was taken over a few times, with friends receiving unwanted messages ostensibly from him. Human Rights situation of HRDs in Azerbaijan In March 2016, Azerbaijan released eight prisoners of conscience — held behind bars simply for speaking out against the government. However, many more prisoners of conscience still remain behind bars and the ongoing reprisals against human rights defenders makes human rights work virtually impossible.

The Attack On August 23, 2017, we observed OilRig targeting an organization within the United Arab Emirates government.

Artifacts The first artifact – identified across this report as Artifact #1 – has the following attributes: Name winexesvc.exe Size 23552 MD5 77e7fb6b56c3ece4ef4e93b6dc608be0 SHA1 f46f84e53263a33e266aae520cb2c1bd0a73354e SHA256 5130f600cd9a9cdc82d4bad938b20cbd2f699aadb76e7f3f1a93602330d9997d The second artifact – identified across this report as Artifact #2 – -has the following attributes: Name svchost.exe.exe Size 1062912 MD5 5e70a5c47c6b59dae7faf0f2d62b28b3 SHA1 cdeea936331fcdd8158c876e9d23539f8976c305 SHA256 730a0e3daf0b54f065bdd2ca427fbe10e8d4e28646a5dc40cbcfb15e1702ed9a Compile Time 2015-04-22 10:49:54 Analysis of Artifact #1 Artifact #1 was retrieved from a File Server operated by Die Linke. The file is a 64bit-compatible compiled binary of the open source utility Winexe . Winexe is software similar to the more popular PSExec and is designed to allow system administrators to execute commands on remote servers. While commercial solutions like Symantec pcAnywhere provide a larger feature-set, Winexe is lightweight, and doesn’t require any installation or configuration. One of the reasons Winexe is preferred over PSExec, is that it provides a Linux client, while PSExec doesn’t. Attackers are making growing use of utilities like Winexe and PSExec to perform lateral movement across compromised networks. Besides providing the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the target system, these utilities normally don’t raise suspicion as they are commonly whitelisted by",0

The first executable is a .NET application, which is no surprise since AgentTesla is very well known for being a .NET key logger. To analyze .NET applications, I prefer to use the application dnSpy and, once loading up this sample, we can see there is only one namespace of interest with a handful of functions and a byte array. The Japanese kanji stands out at first glance but I believe this is less about language and more about being a form of obfuscation – I’ll explain why shortly. Looking at the Main() function shows a pattern of multiple calls to two other functions. Take for example the below string. ゆ.く(ゆ.るこ(New Byte() { 129, 148, 157, 176, 144, 129, 163, 219 })), 1 ゆ . く ( ゆ . るこ ( New Byte ( ) { 129 , 148 , 157 , 176 , 144 , 129 , 163 , 219 } ) ) , The namespace is “ゆ” and the functions are “く” and “るこ”, with the latter taking a byte array as input and then the resulting output of that function being passed to the former. Starting with the first function, there are two XOR operations that occur with what looks like two values from the passed in byte array and then a static XOR key. Looking at this function deeper, it uses the last value in the byte array as one of the 3 XOR keys, then adjusts",0

APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production. From mid-2016 through early 2017, APT33 compromised a U.S. organization in the aerospace sector and targeted a business conglomerate located in Saudi Arabia with aviation holdings. During the same time period, APT33 also targeted a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals. More recently, in May 2017, APT33 appeared to target a Saudi organization and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice victims with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company. We assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to Saudi Arabia indicates that APT33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on Saudi Arabia’s military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s domestic aviation capabilities or to support Iran’s military and strategic decision making vis a vis Saudi Arabia.

In this particular campaign, the attacker(s) targeted specific sets of search keywords that are likely to be queried by potential targets using search engines such as Google. By leveraging compromised web servers, the attacker was able to ensure that their malicious results would be ranked highly within search engines, thus increasing the likelihood that they would be clicked on by potential victims. In one example, the attacker appeared to target the keyword search containing the following search query: In most instances, the attacker was able to get their poisoned results displayed several times on Page 1 of the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) for the keyword search being targeted, in this case ""al rajhi bank working hours in ramadan"". A sample of the malicious results returned by Google is included in the image below. By leveraging compromised business websites that have received ratings and reviews, the attacker could make the results seem more legitimate to victims, as can be seen by the star/rating displayed alongside the results in the SERP.

Most of the samples we found date from the last half of 2017, fewer samples date from 2016, and a handful date back to 2015. In 2018, we have already observed a small but consistent number of samples. We believe this indicates a fairly sustained campaign that has gained momentum over recent months. HenBox Enters the Uyghur App Store In May 2016, a HenBox app was downloaded from uyghurapps[.]net. Specifically, the app was an Android Package (APK) file that will be discussed in more detail shortly. The domain name, language of the site and app content hosted suggest this site is a third-party app store for whom the intended users are the Uyghurs. Such app stores are so-called because they are not officially supported by Android, nor are they provided by Google, unlike the Play Store. Third-party app stores are ubiquitous in China for a number of reasons including: evermore powerful Chinese Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), a lack of an official Chinese Google Play app store, and a growing smartphone market. The HenBox app downloaded in May 2016 was masquerading as the DroidVPN app. At the time of writing, the content served at the given URL on uyghurapps[.]net, is now a legitimate version of the DroidVPN app, and looks as shown in Figure 1 below. Figure 1 Uyghurapps[.]net app store showing the current DroidVPN app Virtual Private Network (VPN) tools allow connections to remote private networks, increasing the security and privacy of the user’s communications. According to the DroidVPN app description, it “helps bypass regional internet restrictions, web filtering and firewalls by tunneling traffic over ICMP.” Some features may require devices to be rooted to function and according to some 3rd party app stores, unconditional rooting is required, which has additional security implications for the device. We have not been able to ascertain how the DroidVPN app on the uyghurapps[.]net app store was replaced with the malicious HenBox app; however, some indicators point to the server running an outdated version of Apache Web Server on a Windows 32-Bit operating system. In light of this, we believe an attack against unpatched vulnerabilities is a reasonable conjecture for how the server was compromised.

One trick involves using either AutoIT or AutoHotKey, simple tools that allow users to write small programs for all sorts of GUI and keyboard automation tasks on Windows. For example, AutoHotKey (AHK) allows users to write code (in its own scripting language) that interacts with Windows, reads text from Windows and sends keystrokes to other applications, among other tasks.

The process chain is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Process chain for the first part of the campaign Although the actual VBS script changed from sample to sample, with different levels of obfuscation and different ways of invoking the next stage of process tree, its final purpose remained same: invoking PowerShell to decode the Base64 encoded PowerShell command in the INI file that was dropped earlier by the macro, and executing it. One such example of the VBS invoking PowerShell via MSHTA is shown in Figure 3.

With these 2 items, the “FillBuffWithEncryptedOsData” routine is able to fill a generic buffer with the calculated data, in a pseudo-random manner. A master key and a payment key are generated using this function (each key is 32 bytes wide), their SHA256 is calculated and finally a custom algorithm is used to shift left and shift right the 2 keys. The two shifted SHA256 values are stored in the “key.dat” file. The Key File The “ OpenKeyFileAndWrite ” routine tries to open the “key.dat” file, located in the user’s Application Data directory. If it doesn’t exist, it generates the 2 master keys (3 in case of the most recent dropper) as well as other keys, and stores them in the key file. Here is a little schema of the layout of the “key.dat” file: * = We currently don’t know precisely how this value is used by TeslaCrypt The latest version of the dropper creates a “RECOVERY_KEY.TXT” file inside the user’s document directory. It does this to achieve a particular goal: if the victim workstation is offline or if a firewall blocks the communication with the C&C server, the dropper will proceed with the destruction of the master key inside the “key.dat” file, after the encryption of all files has been completed. To recover the files, the user would have to connect to the threat actor’s TOR website and provide the recovery key. The threat actors use a custom algorithm to to recover the master key from the recovery key: Click for Larger Image The recovery key file contains 3 pieces of information in an human-readable form, separated by a carriage return character: The Bitcoin address The payment key ID (32 hex digits) The recovery key (64 hex digits) The File Encryption Algorithm File encryption is performed in a dedicated thread. The code for the encryption thread takes the shifted master key, calculates its SHA256 hash and starts to enumerate all files of the victim workstation (filtering by extension type, Tesla Crypt supports over 170 different file extensions ). “EncryptFile” is the function that manages the entire file-encryption process. It: generates a 16-bytes Initialization Vector for AES, using the GetAndHashOsData API function reads the target file initializes the AES encryption algorithm through the creation of the AES context data structure finally encrypts the contents of the file using an AES CBC 256-bit algorithm implemented in the “EncryptWithCbcAes” function. When the process is complete, the new encrypted file is created. The new file contains a small header (composed of the AES Initialization Vector in its first 16 bytes followed by the original file size in the next 4 bytes), and then the actual encrypted bytes. The pop up window displays misleading information: the encryption method is a symmetric AES, and not an asymmetric RSA-2048 as stated by TeslaCrypt in the screenshot above. As proof that TeslaCrypt is truly using symmetric AES and not asymmetric RSA, we provide for a decryption utility capable of decrypting all the files encrypted by this ransomware (provided you have the master key). The Talos TeslaCrypt Decryption Tool Our decryption utility is a command line utility. It needs the “key.dat” file to properly recover the master key used for file encryption. Before it begins execution, it searches for “key.dat” in its original location (the user’s Application Data directory), or in the current directory. If it isn’t able to find and correctly parse the “key.dat” file, it will return an error and exit. Click for Larger Image To use this tool, just copy the “key.dat” file into the tool’s directory and then specify either the encrypted file or a directory containing encrypted files. That’s it! Files should be decrypted and returned to their original content. Here is the list of command line options: /help – Show the help message /key – Manually specify the master key for the decryption (32 bytes/64 digits) /keyfile – Specify the path of the “key.dat” file used to recover the master key. /file – Decrypt an encrypted file /dir – Decrypt all the “.ecc” files in the target directory and its subdirs /scanEntirePc – Decrypt “.ecc” files on the entire computer /KeepOriginal – Keep the original file(s) in the encryption process /deleteTeslaCrypt – Automatically kill and delete the TeslaCrypt dropper (if found active in the target system) Back up your encrypted files before you use this utility.

Introduction Throughout the past couple of years ransomware has dominated the threat landscape and for good reason. It creates a highly profitable business model that allows attackers to directly monetize their nefarious activities. However, there are a couple of limitations with the use of ransomware. First is the fact that only a small percentage of infected users will actually pay the ransom demanded by the attacker. Second, as systems and technology get better at detecting and blocking ransomware attacks the pool of possible victims is changing. Potential victims in many countries lack the financial capabilities to pay $300-$500 to retrieve their data. Possibly related to these aforementioned limitations, we have begun to see a steady shift in the payloads that are being delivered. This is especially true for some of the most common methods for malware distribution such as exploit kits and spam campaigns. Over the past several months Talos has started to observe a marked increase in the volume of cryptocurrency miners being delivered to victims. Cryptocurrency and ""blockchain"" have been all over the news over the past several months as the value of these currencies has increased on an exponential path. One of the most effective ways to generate these currencies is through mining and adversaries are obviously paying attention. What is 'Mining'? At a high level mining is simply using system resources to solve large mathematical calculations which result in some amount of cryptocurrency being awarded to the solvers. Before we get too deep into mining let's address the currencies that make sense to mine. Bitcoin (BTC) is the most well known and widely used cryptocurrency by a wide margin. It's been mined since its inception, but today mining isn't an effective way to generate value. If you look across all of the cryptocurrencies, there are only a couple that are worth mining without specialized hardware called ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). The differences across the different cryptocurrencies are based on the hashing algorithm used. Some have been specifically designed in an attempt to prevent or hinder the use of such specialised hardware and are more focused on consumer grade equipment such as CPU & GPU hardware. Currently, the most valuable currency to mine with standard systems is Monero (XMR) and adversaries have done their research. In addition Monero is extremely privacy conscious and as governments have started to scrutinize Bitcoin more closely, Monero and other coins with heavy emphasis on privacy may become a safe haven for threat actors. There are two ways that mining can be performed, either with a stand alone miner or by leveraging mining pools. Pool-based crypto mining allows you to pool the resources of multiple systems resulting in a higher hashrate and theoretically the production of increased amounts of currency. It's pool-based mining of Monero that we have seen most frequently leveraged by attackers as it allows for the greatest amount of return on investment and the required mining software can be easily delivered to victims. The use of pooled mining also maximizes the effectiveness of the computing resources found in standard systems that attackers attempt to compromise. This is similar to launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks where 100,000 machines flooding a target with bogus traffic becomes much more effective compared to a single system under the attacker's control sending bogus traffic. How does pool based mining work? Pool-based mining is",1

It differs from the transport layer in that it has a mechanism to check for lost messages. While a transport layer session closes with the exchange of data on the number of packets sent and received, a session layer closes by checking that every sent packet has been received correctly. It is up to the server which option to use; for instance, the ‘long’ packet protocol is used for uploading files from an infected computer. Example of short message exchange protocol Short messages At this level, the bot’s operation can be broken down into five steps: Declare session ID to server; Send a message in packets; Send the number of packets sent; Receive the number of incoming packets; Receive incoming packets. A session example: Declare session ID to server Each time a communication session is opened the bot generates a GUID and sends it to the server. This GUID is then used to identify all communications within that session, and is always written in the third-level domain position.

In fact, this type of attack still happens in several parts of the region. Security cameras, CCTV and any other physical security measures proved ineffective in deterring this rudimentary yet extremely effective attack. In many cases, the explosive devices used by the thieves caused damage, not only to the ATMs, but also to bank branches, public squares and the shopping malls in which they were located. A small number of incidents have even caused damage to buildings close to banks. Explosive attacks on ATMs are a rising problem in Europe as well. In a report covering the first six months of 2016, EAST (European Association for Secure Transactions) reported a total of 492 explosive attacks in Europe; a rise of 80 percent compared to the same period in 2015. Such attacks do not just present a financial risk due to stolen cash, but are also the cause of significant collateral damage to equipment and buildings.

You can find below the function that Dridex uses to obtain the EAT. The EAT is copied into a buffer. Once this is done, the malware copies itself and adds a new section into itself (This section has a random name). The dridex copies the obtained ""EAT"" in that section.

This “improved Infy” determines the C2 domain name using a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). It then validates that the C2 domain is authentic. The C2 returns a signature file, which the malware decrypts and compares it with a locally-stored validation file. Once the validity of the C2 is confirmed, stolen data is exfiltrated with a simple HTTP POST. Infection The initial infection vector is a classic spear-phishing email, including a self-executable attachment.

The first command in the logs was issued on June 18, 2016, which was a simple “whoami” command to get the username on the server. This single command was the only one by this specific IP address which appears to be in Iran, and suggests that the actor may have initially compromised the server around this time and performed a quick check to see if the shell was loaded successfully.

These tactics are becoming increasingly common by malware authors in order to evade security products and controls. Two variants of the malware employed by C0d0so0 were discovered—one that used HTTP for command and control (C2) communications, and one that used a custom network protocol over port 22. In these newly discovered C0d0so0 attacks, several of the targeted hosts were identified as server systems, instead of user endpoints, suggesting the possibility that these specific targets will be used in future attacks as additional watering holes.

In contrast, the Elise samples used a mix of actor-registered and DDNS, with the actor-registered serving as one of the data points we used to tie all of the activity together. While the use of DDNS can make tying activity together more difficult, and despite the new Emissary variants since our publication, two of the most recent C2s resolved to IPs used by Elise C2s detailed in Operation Lotus Blossom. The Emissary samples typically have three hardcoded C2s that are a mix of IPs and domain names, with one of the domains or IPs not being used by the other three C2s in a likely effort to avoid loss of control. A full IOC list is included at the end of this report. Also new is the actors’ use of compromised legitimate Taiwanese websites to serve their malware, including the official website of the Democratic Progressive Party. This is particularly interesting as Taiwan just held a closely watched Presidential election on 16 January where DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen won. This marked the first time a woman was elected President of Taiwan and only the second time a member of the Kuomintang did not hold the office since being ousted from China in 1949 when the Communist Party of China took power. In line with her party’s stance, she is widely seen as a proponent of an independent Taiwan and not in favor of reunification with the People’s Republic of China. Malware Updates Our evidence suggests that malware authors created Emissary as early as 2009, which suggests that threat actors have relied on this tool as a payload in cyber-espionage attacks for many years. The Emissary Trojan is a capable tool to gain a foothold on a targeted system. While it lacks more advanced functionality like screen capturing, it is still able to carry out most tasks desired by threat actors: exfiltration of files, ability to download and execute additional payloads, and gain remote shell access. It appears that threat actors have continually used this Trojan, and developed several updated versions of Emissary to remain undetected and fresh over time. We analyzed all of the known Emissary samples to determine what changes the malware author made between the different versions of the Trojan. During our analysis, we examined when each sample was created based on its compile time and produced a simple timeline, seen in Figure 2, to display the development efforts expended on the Emissary Trojan. It should be noted that we know some Emissary samples have been used multiple times with different configurations, so the timeline only shows when development activity took place on Emissary and should not be misconstrued to when Emissary was used in attacks. The timeline in Figure 2 shows that the Emissary Trojan was first created (version 1.0) in May 2009 and quickly received an update that resulted in version 1.1 in June 2009. The Trojan did not receive much in the form of updates until September 2011 when the author released version 2.0.

659,Long_Train,"Scarlet Mimic has deployed Trojans that target the Mac OS X and Android operating systems. We have linked these attacks to Scarlet Mimic through analysis of their command and control (C2) infrastructure. To infect individuals with access to the data the actors desire, Scarlet Mimic deploys both spear-phishing and watering hole (strategic web compromise) attacks. Using these tactics they can directly target previously identified individuals (spear phishing) as well as unidentified individuals who are interested in a specific subject (watering hole). In their spear phishing attacks, Scarlet Mimic has exploited five separate vulnerabilities. However, in many cases they chose to forgo exploiting a software vulnerability and used self-extracting (SFX) RAR archives that use the Right-to-Left Override character to mask the true file extension, tricking victims into opening executable files. As with many other attackers who use spear-phishing to infect victims, Scarlet Mimic makes heavy use of “decoy” files. These are legitimate documents that contain content relevant to the subject of the spear phishing e-mail. After the system is infected, the malware displays the decoy document to trick the user into believing nothing harmful has occurred. These decoy documents allow us to identify the theme of the spear phishing e-mail and in some cases the target of the attack. The most recent Scarlet Mimic attacks we have identified were conducted in 2015 and suggest the group has a significant interest in both Muslim activists and those interested in critiques of the Russian government and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Based on their previous targets we suspect these individuals may be targeted based on the information they posses on activist groups. The primary source of data used in this analysis is Palo Alto Networks WildFire , which analyzes malware used in attacks across the world. The system also analyzes malware samples collected through a sharing partnership with other security vendors, including our partners in the Cyber Threat Alliance . To connect attacks to each other based on malware behavior and command and control infrastructure, we relied on AutoFocus threat intelligence. AutoFocus users can view all of the files related to Scarlet Mimic and the malware associated with the group using the following links: ScarletMimic FakeM Psylo MobileOrder Introduction The better we can understand the threats to our networks and systems, the more effective we will be at preventing those threats. The goal of this report is to help network defenders better understand attacks from a group we have named Scarlet Mimic. This group has been conducting attacks for at least four years using a backdoor Trojan that has been under active development. The group primarily deploys spear-phishing e-mails to infect its targets, but was also responsible for a watering hole (strategic web compromise) attack in 2013. Attacks from this group have been reported publicly in the past, but mostly as disparate, unconnected incidents.

Once the observed Gmail account was under their control, the actors then forwarded malware to over a hundred of their contacts, ranging from an address for the United Nations Refugee Agency in Turkey to a site contact for Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The incident represents only a more recent example of a common set of tactic and tools that have been used by a discrete set of actors in Iran.

It is highly likely the adversary then used spear-phishing attacks containing links to these malicious documents as a delivery mechanism. We were ultimately able to identify multiple organizations in the government, energy, and technology sectors targeted by Magic Hound. The weaponized documents themselves all contained malicious macros which were designed to call Windows PowerShell to retrieve additional tools. A handful of lures with different themes were used repeatedly with variations throughout the eighteen collected documents. They ranged from documents masquerading as official Saudi government forms to a holiday greetings card. The forms masquerading as official government documents specifically used imagery from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Commerce claiming to be mandatory forms that required macros to be enabled. Examples of the documents can be seen below: INFRASTRUCTURE Analysis of the weaponized documents revealed some peculiarities right away. The majority of documents used the name “gerry knight” for the author field in the document metadata, and the embedded macros largely used direct IP connections to command and control (C2) servers rather than using domain names. These C2 servers also appeared to lack any relationships to each other and were hosted on a variety of VPS providers. Two of the Word documents using the “gerry knight” author name however were found to be communicating to C2 servers on two specific domains, www1.chrome-up[.]date and www3.chrome-up[.]date. Using these domains as pivot points, we were able to expand our data set. As seen below, the relational analysis proved to be quite fruitful: Figure 1 Overview of relationships We rapidly discovered a different set of tools communicating to the exact same C2 servers as those two Word documents, in addition to other tools communicating to other subdomain variations of chrome-up[.]date as seen in the following graphic: Figure 2 Command and control overlaps From there, we were able to map out a large infrastructure separating out into four categories of tools: downloaders, droppers, loaders, and payloads. What initially appeared as a disparate and segregated attack campaign appeared very rapidly to be a persistent and prolonged attack campaign with very specific goals in mind. In total, we were able to collect over fifty different samples via infrastructure reuse, behavioral matching, and the reuse of a specific file for maintaining persistence. These tools included Microsoft Office documents, portable executables (PE), .NET Framework PE files, Meterpreter, IRC bots, an open sourced Meterpreter module called Magic Unicorn, and an open sourced Python RAT called Pupy. Interestingly as we continued to expand and pivot in our data set, one of the C2 IPs used by an IRC bot payload from Magic Hound was found to be the same IP used to deliver a different IRC bot called MPK. Figure 3 Rocket Kitten and Magic Hound infrastructure overlap The MPK bot is not publicly available and had previously been attributed to an adversary group called “Rocket Kitten” which has often been thought to be a state sponsored adversary operating in the Middle East region.

Our analysis shows that SpyDealer is currently under active development. There are three versions of this malware currently in the wild, 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3. Starting from 1.9.3, content of configuration files and almost all constant strings in the code are encrypted or encoded. An accessibility service was also introduced in 1.9.3 to steal targeted apps’ messages. According to our dataset, most of these samples use the app name “GoogleService” or “GoogleUpdate”. The most recent sample we have observed was created in May, 2017 while the oldest sample dates back to October, 2015, indicating this malware family has been active for over a year and a half. We also observed evidence of infected users discussing the malware in October 2015 and February 2016 as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Real infection instances in the wild Detailed Technical Analysis Service Launching and Configuration After installed on an Android device, SpyDealer shows no application icon. However, it registers two broadcast receivers to listen for events related to the device booting up and network connection status. Whenever any of these events are broadcasted, the key service component AaTService starts. At the first launch, it retrieves configuration information from the local asset file named readme.txt. The first line of this file indicates the IP address of a remote C2 server, the second line configures what actions the malware can take on mobile networks, and the third line specifies what actions are allowed under a Wi-Fi network. The configuration settings can also be remotely updated by various C2 channels. One example of the readme.txt is given in Figure 2. The full list of the IP addresses for the remote C2 servers is available in Appendix B. A partial listing of the configurable actions is depicted in Table 1.

Traditionally RATs have been deployed when a user opens an email attachment, or downloads a file from a website or peer-to-peer network.

Interestingly, in those cases a wiper very similar to prior BlackEnergy malware was deployed and, when that was blocked by our Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) product, the actor fell back to using a ransomware variant in an attempt to disrupt the organization’s activities. With this recent history in mind, we were immediately concerned that there was more to this story than just another ransomware attack. Early on it became clear that, while a majority of the early events were in Ukraine, the malware was infecting organizations that didn’t immediately have any known connection to the country. Because of the scale of the event, Talos initiated an internal response management system call TaCERS (Talos Critical Event Response System) and began the research and response process. TaCERS divides up activities into intelligence, telemetry analysis, reverse engineering, communications and detection research. Talos researchers and engineers from around the world came together to address this threat. Based on endpoint telemetry, it was clear that a Ukranian accounting software package called “M.E.Doc” was at the center of activity. Like WannaCry, there were reports of an email vector. This is most likely because some of the earliest infected machines had concurrent Lokibot infections with indications of an email vector for that malware. After careful research Talos concluded that for the delivery of the Nyetya malware, all installations came through the M.E.Doc update system. M.E.Doc is a widely deployed",0

The exploit file, movie.swf, was ZWS compressed, a tactic that has been observed to evade anti-virus programs. Once uncompressed, a binary was found to be embedded in the Flash file. Upon further analysis, this file was found to contain behavior consistent with a Trojan commonly called IsSpace . Based on its codebase and behavioral patterns, it appears that IsSpace could possibly be an evolution of the NFlog backdoor, which has previously been attributed to the adversary groups DragonOK and Moafee. Both groups are thought to be operating out of Southeast Asia, and Moafee in particular has been associated with attacks on the US defense industrial base .

This makes the files unrecoverable unless the author made a mistake in the implementation of the encryption algorithms. The adversaries behind this ransomware variant did not go to any length to disguise or cover up the ransomware activity on the system. The samples Talos obtained are not packed and do not contain anti-debugging features. One interesting note regarding the samples Talos has observed is that the malware will abort the encryption routine if the system is running a version of Microsoft Windows prior to Vista. This is likely done for compatibility reasons. Once installed on a machine there is no beaconing or C2 activity. The ransomware is effectively self sufficient.

The purpose of this attack was to make it possible for users of two iOS jailbreak tweaks to download applications from the official App Store and make in-app purchases without actually paying. Jailbreak tweaks are software packages that allow users to perform actions that aren’t typically possible on iOS. These two tweaks will hijack app purchase requests, download stolen accounts or purchase receipts from the C2 server, then emulate the iTunes protocol to log in to Apple’s server and purchase apps or other items requested by users. The tweaks have been downloaded over 20,000 times, which suggests around 20,000 users are abusing the 225,000 stolen credentials. Some victims have reported that their stolen Apple accounts show abnormal app purchasing history and others state that their phones have been held for ransom. Palo Alto Networks and WeipTech have provided services to detect the KeyRaider malware and identify stolen credentials. In the remainder of this blog, we provide details about the malware and the attacks. Finding KeyRaider The attack was first discovered by i_82, a student from Yangzhou University and member of WeipTech. WeipTech (Weiphone Tech Team) is an amateur technical group consisting of users from Weiphone – one of the largest Apple fans websites in China. Previously, WeipTech cooperated with us to report on other iOS and OS X malware including AppBuyer and WireLurker . Beginning in July 2015, WeipTech members began investigating reports that some users’ Apple accounts were used to make unauthorized purchases and to install iOS apps. By looking at jailbreak tweaks these users had installed, they found one tweak that collected user information and uploaded it to an unexpected website. They then",0
715,Long_Train,"this instance, we see two different exploits, as well as two methods of bypassing ASLR exploit mitigations. The first method was published in 2014 by Parvez Anwar. The method he describes involves creating an embedded OLE object which contains a ProgID for “otkloadr.WRAssembly.1”. This causes MSVCR71.DLL to be loaded, a library which is not compiled with /DYNAMICBASE. When using OLE to perform exploitation, ActiveX objects can be used to cite specific CLSID values. This is useful to an attacker as many of these CLSID values map to DLLs on the system. Attackers can deliberately use this to load any DLL they desire into the affected application so long as it maps to a valid CLSID. This method was actually described at Black Hat USA 2015 in the talk: “ Attacking Interoperability: An OLE Edition ” by researchers Haifei Li and Bing Sun of Intel Security. As a result of this method, it is possible for the attacker to force the loading of less secure libraries which were not compiled with the /DYNAMICBASE compiler flag (enables ASLR at compile time), or other libraries which further enable the corruption and manipulation of memory. From the RTF document, we can use oletools to extract each OLE object. Thus far, we have encountered two weaponized RTF documents. Interestingly, both documents contained identical OLE objects: 7ff9ff29b79d0eb38813bfa0b0bb1c5b116d1f9e5468ae52674bb443468658d9 object_00000020.bin 7f29f2dc8b60c0e5a22575d9c76fd9c3d39604d1acf5cb4d938a63095c61a72e object_000000E6.bin fe80d59686806afe3dc48f73d54b577558a7c871da17d08d937c5d7b3564e07b object_000187A1.bin 70ea7ef3bf9966c3297a4e78024e3083013558670d051c2ca3095e2588a576d8 object_0002802C.bin Closer examination of each of the OLE objects",0

Registering a domain name always requires some form of identifying information: a physical or mailing address, an email address, and a phone number. Of these, a valid email address holds the greatest importance because it is where the registrar sends the confirmation of a domain purchase to the new owner in addition to the information needed to control the domain. Most fraudsters create one-time email addresses or use stolen email addresses, both of which are easy to create or obtain. However, over time, it becomes tedious for fraudsters to constantly change information when registering new domains.

The actor then uses this server to compromise other systems on the network by using the hostname to copy over and execute the Disttrack malware. On each of these named systems that are successfully compromised, the Disttrack malware will attempt to propagate itself to 256 additional IP addresses on the local network. This rudimentary, but effective, distribution system can enable Disttrack to propagate to additional systems from a single, initially compromised system in a semi-automated fashion.

Finally, as a note regarding recent statements by the FBI informing users that they should just pay the ransom if they have no alternative, Talos strongly encourages users to not pay the ransom as doing so directly funds this malicious activity. Infection Process The adversaries behind CryptoWall 4 are using phishing and drive-by-download campaigns to distribute their malware to their victims. Once CryptoWall 4 has been successfully executed, the dropper downloads an RSA public encryption key from the command and control (C2) server. All files are encrypted with a temporary AES encryption key, which is later encrypted with the downloaded RSA public key and embedded in the encrypted files. Then it shows its message in three different formats. The first is a text file, the second is an image (.png format) and thirdly an HTML document. All are automatically opened on the victim's desktop as shown in Figure A.1 below. Figure A.2-5 are showing the full text of the HTML document. Figure A.1 Figure A.2 Figure A.3 Figure A.4 Figure A.5 One interesting observation with CryptoWall 4 is if it cannot retrieve the public RSA encryption key from the C2 server it will enter a loop constantly attempting to download the public key.

The combination of a legitimate administration tool being used to install a back-door onto a target system is unique and is why this attack caught our attention. Another characteristic of this attack that was notable is how adversaries went to great lengths to spoof a phishing message that would appear credible to the user. In this attack, an actual business was impersonated, using the logo and physical address of the business, in order to appear legitimate. The bait in this case is a Microsoft Word document containing a macro that downloads and executes a binary from hxxp://frontlinegulf[.]com/tmp/adobefile.exe.

Throughout our investigation, adversaries changed the payload hosted on the external host several times.

While the inclusion of AutoIT is unique, the AutoIT script contained the actual functionality that performed anti-analysis checks, payload decryption, malware installation, and persistence. This was also unusual because these bits of functionality are typically concealed and executed from an encrypted binary instead of a script. Ultimately, the",0

Figure 1 Decoy document containing written application form Figure 2 Decoy document containing the invitation and agenda for event Exploiting CVE-2014-6332 The threat actors attempted to exploit CVE-2014-6332 using the POC code available in the wild. The POC code contains inline comments that explain how the malicious VBScript exploits this vulnerability, so instead of discussing the malicious script or exploit itself, we will focus on the portions of the script that the threat actors modified. The actors removed the explanatory comments from the VBScript and made slight modifications to the POC code. The only major functional difference between the POC and the VBScript involved adding the ability to extract and run both a decoy document and payload. Figure 3 and 4 compare the differing “runshell” command within the POC and the malicious documents used in this attack. The code in Figure 3 shows that the POC does nothing more than launch the notepad.exe application upon successful exploitation.

The data Unit 42 has collected and analyzed however, does strongly point to the possibility that while there may be multiple operations groups, a Digital Quartermaster may be the one supplying and maintaining the tools used. Attack Analysis While investigating new BBSRAT instances discovered using the AutoFocus tool, Unit 42 was able to collect additional samples, weaponized documents, and phishing emails uploaded to VirusTotal between August 2015 through February 2016. Each of the samples collected via WildFire and VirusTotal contained significant overlaps in tactics used, tools used, as well as infrastructure for command and control channels. In addition, a large majority of the samples gathered from VirusTotal were uploaded from a single entity in Mongolia. The attacks themselves followed a consistent playbook throughout the observed timeframe; using weaponized Microsoft Word documents initially containing an exploit for only CVE-2012-0158, appearing to use the highly popular ‘Tran Duy Linh’ toolkit, then adding in an additional exploit for CVE-2014-1761 in the three newest samples we collected. The newer documents containing exploits for both vulnerabilities appeared to use a publically available PoC authored by ‘HCL’, with little to no modifications made. All of the weaponized documents except two executed the Cmstar loader or a lightly modified variant of Cmstar onto the victim host while displaying a decoy document or a legitimate appearing document that is generated and presented to the user to make it appear that the weaponized document that had been executed was indeed, legitimate.

Investigators put the origin of the attack as Iranian; Morphisec’s research supports this conclusion and attributes the attacks to the same infamous hacker group responsible for the OilRig malware campaigns. The fileless attack was delivered via Microsoft Word documents that exploited a former zero-day vulnerability in Word, CVE-2017-0199, to install a fileless attack variant of the Helminth Trojan agent. Microsoft released the patch for the vulnerability on April 11, but many organizations have not yet deployed the update. The attackers actually based their attack on an existing Proof-of-Concept method that was published by researchers after the patch release. By hunting through known malware repositories, Morphisec identified matching samples uploaded by Israeli high-tech development companies, medical organizations and education organizations, indicating that they were victims of the attack. For security purposes, Morphisec is not revealing these names. The delivery was executed by compromising the email accounts of a few high-profile individuals at Ben-Gurion University.

The custom malware was submitted by a user in Bangladesh, and contains sophisticated functionality for interacting with local SWIFT Alliance Access software running in the victim infrastructure. This malware appears to be just part of a wider attack toolkit, and would have been used to cover the attackers’ tracks as they sent forged payment instructions to make the transfers. This would have hampered the detection and response to the attack, giving more time for the subsequent money laundering to take place. The tools are highly configurable and given the correct access could feasibly be used for similar attacks in the future.

The contact (Lyubomir Bambov) is mentioned with an address in Bulgaria but we all know Internet databases are purely declarative so the Verdina client could have say anything. Second, the domain absentvodka.com does not have public data (hidden behind a proxy) so you cannot really tell.

If you downloaded another release or another edition, this does not affect you. If you downloaded via torrents or via a direct HTTP link, this doesn’t affect you either.’ I’m afraid this is not right. Friday the 20th I downloaded 3 iso’s. At first a 17.3 64bit XFCE via torrent. Checked the MD5sum: faulty result. Deleted the download. Secondly tried a direct download for again 17.3 64bit XFCE. Same problem, incorrect MD5sum – deleted. Couple of hours later I downloaded a 17.3 64bit Cinnamon, directly from Heanet. After checking the MD5sum and getting bad result I deleted and gave up. I probably should have informed you guys (earlier), which I unfortunately didn’t. Sorry for that. Reply Florian says: February 21, 2016 at 11:39 am Hello Clem, as a friend and promoter of Linux Mint, I am a bit surprised that in your reply to Fred Barclay’s Post (#11 ITT) you don’t react at all to his constructive suggestion of using PGP signatures for download verification, but instead fully ignore it and talk about the oh so great security of duplicated md5sums. Cryptographic signing with PGP is the global de facto standard for secure verification of digital data, which can’t be stressed enough. On the contrary, posting (known insecure) md5sums on the same (hacked) website (wordpress!) as the download link itself and not even providing secure https connections, is IMHO for the very least *grossly negligent* and hard to not interpret as a dead canary. I am well aware that 100% security is an illusion – and the closer we get, the harder they fight. But the tools to massively improve it are at our fingertips. Nevertheless thanks for this great distro!

Edit by Clem: The fake ISO in Sofia, the OS backdoor in Sofia also, the guy accessing our server via the second backdoor from Russia, but when you look at a hole and see somebody looking at you, you need to figure out who knows more than the other, and if we’re reacting to their actions it was pretty clear we had to take everything down. The hacker from Russia (could be a VPN of course) even DDOSed my personal IP to prevent me from taking the site down. He also took down part of his set up since. Reply Roland says: February 21, 2016 at 1:22 pm I DID download and install Linux 32bit Cinnamon yesterday, Feb 20th from a German server. The md5 checksum was valid. However, there was an error message during install that caught my attention: “EDID checksum is invalid reminder is 45” (or so) I downloaded, burnt and installed twice, I got the same error message each time. Might not have anything to do with the Bulgarians, but I still wanted to let You know. I’m new to Linux Mint, and boy is this exciting. I just wanted to create an account on linuxmint.org to post this, but had to post here instead. Of course I am wondering if my iso is corrupted, but I’ll probably reinstall either way. Edit by Clem: Hi, it’s not related. The MD5 sum of the hacked ISO would not match. Reply GaryJ says: February 21, 2016 at 1:22 pm What evidence have you got that the attack was via WordPress? If it’s something in core (extremely unlikely), then you should report it responsibly. More likely it’s from a poorly coded plugin or theme, which should also be reported responsibly to the author concerned. Or, it’s due to lax file permissions or other server mis-configuration. Either way, accusing WordPress (core) without any further details is detrimental to all. Edit by Clem: We found an uploaded php backdoor in the theme directory of a wordpress installation, which was 1 day old and had no plugins running. The theme was new but most importantly I think we had lax file permissions on this. This was only set up hours before the attack but we were probably scanned for something like this for a while. Anyhow, we don’t know yet how it was uploaded but we know it happened there, and I’m certainly not pointing the finger at anybody. People just asked if we were running wordpress or if wordpress was used in the attack and I answered yes.

796,Long_Train,"relies heavily on the registry for staging and storage of configuration data while avoiding more traditional on-access endpoint scanning of files on disk. It also uses a key in the registry to maintain persistence, and relies on PowerShell to install itself on the infected host. When first delivered and executed on a victim's machine, the malware is in the portable executable (PE) format. Its first task, however, is to install itself to the system in a less suspicious form, namely as an HTML Application (HTA) that will load the malware from the registry. Installation begins by creating several registry keys containing the different parts of the loader as well as the data of the malware PE. The malware reads all the information embedded in its data section and creates three new randomly named registry keys, each holding a different stage of the loader code needed to execute the malware PE using reflective injection. Next, the HTA loader is written to the CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA folder (typically C:\ProgramData\) and set to execute each time the user logs on by adding an entry to the ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"" registry key. An example of an HTA loader and the accompanying registry entries necessary to execute the malware once installed are: 17T21vYHOb.hta :: e4a49af295d6e61877a458a014fe63b733be942c506496b53070aa3d9ca421d8 ZfjrAilGdH.reg :: 5863f35959aa542a27319e098f40166f3ace09d265f4ec6d739318c0b739745e This registry file contains the following subkeys in the key HKLM\Software\ZfjrAilGdH which are set by the installation process (the key names are randomly generated and will be different for each installation): Lvt4wLGLMZ :: JScript executed by ZfjrAilGdh.hta kCu2DZ9WI0 :: PowerShell used to reflectively inject the malware 4FLJBnefsN :: hex data representing the malware PE Fileless malware loader The HTA is heavily obfuscated but when cleaned up, evaluates to an eval of the JScript in the registry key ""HKLM\Software\ZfjrAilGdh\Lvt4wLGLMZ"" via a ""ActiveXObject.WScript.Shell.RegRead"" (shown here as pseudo code): The JScript in the reg key executes the following powershell (shown here deobfuscated): This code will execute the code found in the registry location HKLM\Software\ZfjrAilGdH\kCu2DZ9WI0 after setting the variable regkeyname to the data found in the registry location HKLM\Software\ZfjrAilGdH\4FLJBnefsN.

After gaining access to the victim’s machine, the attackers deploy a range of post-exploitation tools, many of them based on publicly available code often found on Chinese programming portals. One of these tools stood out, a bespoke Trojan that abuses Microsoft Accessibility Features to gain SYSTEM-level access on the compromised machine in a way similar to the infamous ""Sticky Keys"" attack . In this case, instead of replacing the usual sethc.exe or utilman.exe binaries, the attackers chose to Trojanize the Narrator executable - a Windows utility that reads aloud the text on the screen and can be invoked on the login screen with a keyboard shortcut. The use of Fake Narrator to gain SYSTEM-level access to the victim’s machine suggests the attackers are interested in maintaining a long-term foothold. The campaign is characterized by a fair level of stealthiness as the threat actor made a concerted effort to avoid detection. The use of DLL side-loading technique together with a bespoke loader utilizing memory injection ensures that the main backdoor binary is never dropped to the disk. A simple but effective anti-sandboxing technique of payload encoding based on execution path is also implemented to avoid detection. The C&C infrastructure is protected by a level of indirection. The configuration supplied by the loader is passed as plain text, but the URL it contains is not the real C&C address. It instead points to a remote file that provides the actual details to be used in the C&C communication. This allows the attackers to easily change the preferred C&C address, decide the timing of the communication, and – by applying server-side filtering – restrict",0

Emotet's email propagation One of Emotet's most devious methods of self-propagation centers around its use of socially engineered spam emails. Emotet's reuse of stolen email content is extremely effective. Once they have swiped a victim's email, Emotet constructs new attack messages in reply to some of that victim's unread email messages, quoting the bodies of real messages in the threads. The email above illustrates Emotet's social engineering.

However, it is practically impossible to separate them from each other, mainly because some variants using different versioning use the same string decryption key, and the same mechanisms are used in different variants. Moreover, the differences are not important from the functionality point of view. Therefore, we will refer to all these variants as Casbaneiro. Casbaneiro is easy to identify by its use of a huge string table, with several hundred entries. Strings are retrieved by accessing this table by index. Curiously, whenever the malware needs to obtain a string, the whole string table is constructed in memory from stored chunks of encrypted text, the desired string is decrypted and the whole table is discarded again. You can see an example in Figure 2. Figure 2. Casbaneiro obtaining a string by index (0x205) and decrypting it There are strong indicators that this malware family is closely connected to Amavaldo, which we described in our first post in this series about Latin American banking trojans. We will mention these similarities later in this article. Hijacking clipboard data Casbaneiro can also try to steal victim’s cryptocurrency. It does so by monitoring the content of the clipboard and if the data seem to be a cryptocurrency wallet, it replaces them with the attacker’s own. This technique is not new; it has been used by other malware in the past – even the infamous BackSwap banking trojan implemented it in its earliest stages. The attacker’s wallet is hardcoded in the binary and we have encountered only one. By examining it, we can see payments were already made at the time of writing. Figure 3.

This window is always shown at startup and thus it is a good indicator of infection. While this functionality isn’t novel in any sense and no sandbox evasion was utilized, the obfuscation was uncommon enough to gain our attention. The combination of control flow obfuscation and low level code abstraction made the analysis of the malware’s workflow rather tedious. This, in combination with the low detection rate on VirusTotal (6 out of 66 as of 7/8/2019), provided us a great excuse to rummage through our toolbox to perform the analysis. Moreover, during the analysis, we found that the obfuscated loader also utilises a (possibly) custom stack-based virtual machine during the RC4 key schedule, which aroused our interest even more.

This tool, a TTP observed in ITG08 attacks since 2018, is sold on the dark web by an underground malware-as-a-service (MaaS) provider. Attackers use it to create, expand and cement their foothold in compromised environments. Past campaigns by ITG08 using the More_eggs backdoor were last reported in February 2019 . In the campaign we investigated, the attackers employed additional TTPs historically associated with ITG08, including the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to automate the remote execution of PowerShell scripts, PowerShell commands with base64 encoding, and Metasploit and PowerShell to move laterally and deploy malware. Lastly, the attackers used Comodo code-signing certificates several times during the course of the campaign. Many of the above TTPs are not unique to ITG08, but collectively, and with the use of More_eggs, strengthen the link to this group. Let’s take a closer look at ITG08’s TTPs that are relevant to the campaign we investigated, starting with its spear phishing and intrusion tactics and covering information on its use of the More_eggs backdoor. Please note that Visa has attributed the use of this backdoor to FIN6 in attacks that took place in 2018. Further linking the activity with the same threat actor, several of the network indicators and TTPs we encountered in this case — including the use of fake job advertisements as a lure in spear phishing — overlap with those reported earlier in 2019 by both Visa and Proofpoint researchers. Analysis of the Intrusion ITG08’s TTPs in compromising targeted organizations follow the typical framework for APT attacks .

A case in point: the way Skidmap can also set up a secret master password that gives it access to any user account in the system. Conversely, given that many of Skidmap’s routines require root access, the attack vector that Skidmap uses — whether through exploits, misconfigurations, or exposure to the internet — are most likely the same ones that provide the",0

If the system was previously configured to mine cryptocurrency, the installation script would terminate their execution using the kill command: The script then uses the touch command to determine its capability to write to various directories on the filesystem.

CVE-2014-8361 – Realtek RTL81XX Chipset – Present in JenX as well. Targeted IoT Devices – Wi-Fi SOHO Routers Starting in 2016, we’ve observed that wireless routers are one of the most common IoT devices in organizations across industries, making them targets for IoT botnets, degrading the production network and the reputation of the IP addresses of the affected company. Additionally, botnets gain access to IoT devices by using exploits instead of typical dictionary attacks (in which the botnet attempts to log in to the device via unsecured services such as telnet). This helps the botnet spread more easily through IoT devices even if administrators have disabled unsecured services and applied strong login passwords. Gafgyt is a botnet that was uncovered in 2014 and has become popular for launching large-scale DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks.

There have been incidents of cryptojacking malware spreading as a worm , but this is the first time we see a cryptojacking worm spread using containers in the Docker Engine (Community Edition). Because most traditional endpoint protection software does not inspect data and activities inside containers, this type of malicious activity can be difficult to detect. The malicious actor gained an initial foothold through unsecured Docker daemons , where a Docker image was first installed to run on the compromised host. The malware, which was downloaded from command and control (C2) servers, is deployed to mine for Monero and periodically queries for new vulnerable hosts from the C2 and picks the next target at random to",0

These techniques demonstrate that executable content could theoretically be hidden within any file type, provided the attacker does not corrupt the structure and processing of the container format. Adopting this strategy introduces an additional layer of obfuscation because the underlying code is only revealed in memory, making detection more challenging. It is worth noting that the steganography loader we discovered is also identified in Symantec's June 2019 analysis [1] of Waterbug/Turla threat actor activity. In addition, Symantec identified WAV files containing encoded Metasploit code. These similarities may point to a relationship between the attacks, though definitive attribution is challenging because different threat actors may use similar tools. Also, our analysis focuses primarily on loaders, which are an initial stage of execution used to launch additional code. Different threat actors may use the same publicly available loader to execute unrelated second-stage malware. Loaders Steganography PE Loader Overview The first category of loaders employs steganography to extract executable content from a WAV file. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file or message within another file, ideally without raising suspicion about the target file. Attackers have used steganography techniques to hide data in the past; in fact, BlackBerry Cylance Threat Research published a report [2] in April that describes how the OceanLotus Threat Group leveraged steganography to conceal malicious backdoor payloads within image files. In this instance, code is hidden within the audio file using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique, where the right-most bit of an individual byte contains the data of interest. One publicly available [3] WAV file loader we discovered has the following characteristics: SHA-256 595A54F0BBF297041CE259461AE8A12F37FB29E5180705EAFB3668B4A491CECC File Type",0

A second campaign used Meterpreter, a publicly available backdoor along with two custom loaders, a custom backdoor called photobased.dll, and a custom Remote Procedure Call (RPC) backdoor. Waterbug has been using Meterpreter since at least early 2018 and, in this campaign, used a modified version of Meterpreter, which was encoded and given a .wav extension in order to disguise its true purpose. The third campaign deployed a different custom RPC backdoor to that used in the second campaign. This backdoor used code derived from the publicly available PowerShellRunner tool to execute PowerShell scripts without using powershell.exe. This tool is designed to bypass detection aimed at identifying malicious PowerShell usage. Prior to execution, the PowerShell scripts were stored Base64-encoded in the registry. This was probably done to avoid them being written to the file system. Figure 1.

While our campaign’s timeline seems to overlap with last week’s ESTsecurity report on the “Operation Extreme Job” campaign targeting South Korean security companies, we have observed different tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) employed in the two operations. It is long believed among the security community that Lazarus is divided into at least two subdivisions: the first named Andariel which focuses primarily on attacking the South Korean government and organizations, and the second, Bluenoroff, whose main focus is monetization and global espionage campaigns. The differences between the two campaigns, which were conducted at the same time, provides wind once again to the theory that multiple divisions are at work here. This incident, however, represents an unusual choice of victim by the North Korean threat actor. Usually, these attacks reflect the geopolitical tensions between the DPRK and nations such as the U.S, Japan and South Korea.

In multiple instances, we noticed the attacker used open or compromised mail servers in South America to facilitate the campaigns. The attacker also connected to the compromised servers from IP addresses that were linked to dynamic domain names used as C&Cs by the delivered payloads. This suggests that the attacker uses the same infrastructure to send emails and control victims. The sender of the email is usually spoofed, and we saw multiple email subjects enticing the receiver to open the attachment, which is an RTF file. Examples of such subjects are: “Hemos iniciado un proceso en su contra por violencia laboral.” (Loosely translates to “We have filed a lawsuit against you for workplace violence.”) “Se hara efectivo un embargo a su(s) cuenta(s) Bancarias.” (Loosely translates to “Your banking accounts are going to be blocked.”) “Almacenes exito te obsequia una tarjeta regalo virtual por valor de $500.000.” (Loosely translates to “Exito",0
883,Long_Train,"influential threat actor groups in Southeast Asia. We created statistics about their activities through the more than 800 malware executables that the SectorF01 group used to attack. About 800 malwares used in the statistics are all Windows executables. Polymorphic binaries which are executed by sandboxes and whose file hashes change each time they are run are excluded from these statistics, so only the initial file is included. We are excluding such polymorphic binaries which are not used in attacks to minimize statistical errors and misinterpretation. This is a graph aggregating the number of malwares used in attacks by the SectorF01 group every year. It can be seen that the number of malware that they use each year is steadily increasing. The Growth of the SectorF01 group’s Malware The following are the statistics for the time and day when the SectorF01 group created the malware. We have analyzed about seven years of cyber espionage activity of the SectorF01 group and have concluded that they are highly likely to be threat actor groups sponsored by the Vietnamese government. We created statistics on compile times with the timestamp of about 500 binaries, after excluding those considered to have modified timestamps among the 800 binaries. Assuming that the SectorF01 group is active in Vietnam, we set the time zone to “UTC+7″(Vietnam time zone) and created statistics based on that. Considering that the business hours in Vietnam are mainly from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, about 68% of the malwares were created in Vietnam business hours. Also, binaries were rarely created at lunch time. SectorF01 Group’s Malware Compile Time (UTC+7) Next, we created statistics for the days when the SectorF01 group created binaries. The SectorF01 group made binaries on weekdays rather than weekends. About 86% of malware were made on weekdays. Among them, most binaries were produced on Mondays. The days of the week that the SectorF01 group compiled their binaries SectorF01 Groups’s Initial Access Tactics The SectorF01 group uses a variety of methods for initial penetration. They mainly use malware delivered to the target via email attachments and at other times, infect specific targets that access websites via watering hole attacks. Here we describe the various initial penetration methods they have used. Spearphishing Attachment & Spearphishing Link The SectorF01 group usually delivers their malware through email attachments or links. The definition of these techniques can be found in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. “Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution.” T1193, Spearphishing Attachment MITRE ATT&CK “Spearphishing with a link is a",1

The following technical analysis focuses on the bespoke QuasarRAT loader developed by MenuPass and modifications made to the QuasarRAT backdoor. Introducing the QuasarRAT Loader Overview The QuasarRAT loader typically arrives as a 64-bit service DLL. Its primary purpose is to decrypt, load and invoke an embedded .NET assembly in-memory using the CppHostCLR technique. This technique is based on code snippets from Microsoft DevCentre examples.

Regarding the nature of the applications targeted, it is interesting to observe that their purpose is related to audio production; thus, the machines that they are installed on should have good processing power and high CPU consumption will not surprise the users. Also, these applications are usually complex, so it is not unexpected for them to be huge files. The attackers use this to their advantage to camouflage their VM images.

Even though Angler did make use of a zero-day in Adobe Flash Player years ago , exploit kits largely depend on existing, patched exploits. However, all it takes is one missed patch on one system to lead directly to compromise. That's why you need things like a thorough defense-in-depth approach with various technologies in place to help mitigate any residual risk that comes with running an enterprise. Background on exploit kits Exploit kits are something Talos has covered in the past, including some more memorable deep dives . The goal of exploit kits is fairly straightforward: compromise random victims on the internet using disclosed vulnerabilities to deliver a malicious payload. It achieves this through a couple of components: a traffic direction system (TDS) or gate, landing page and exploit page. The challenge for most adversaries is getting traffic to their kits — and there are a couple of different methods to get it there.

It finds the kernel.dll address via its CRC32 checksum. Then, it resolves the addresses of basic API calls by name by iterating over the InMemoryOrderModuleList in the PEB_LDR_DATA structure. Next, it resolves the address of the wanted API call by using a custom hash function. Finally, it uses CallWindowProcW to execute the resolved API call. Besides the aforementioned obfuscation techniques, some API calls are additionally obfuscated by using direct syscalls via the sysenter instruction on 32-bit systems and the Heaven's Gate technique on x64 systems.

If they do not spend time debugging their malware, they risk their malware not functioning correctly on victim hosts, or not being able to successfully communicate with their malware remotely. How PDB Paths are Made (the birds and the PDBs?) But how are PDBs created and connected to programs? Let’s examine the formation of one PDB path through the eyes of a malware developer and blogger, the soon-to-be-infamous “smiller.” Smiller has a lot of programming projects and organizes them in an aptly labeled folder structure on his computer. This project is for a shellcode loader embedded in an HTML Application (HTA) file, and the developer stores it quite logically in the folder: D:\smiller\projects\super_evil_stuff\shellcode\ Figure 1: The simple “Test” project code file “Program.cs” which embeds a piece of shellcode and a launcher executable within an HTML Application (HTA) file Figure 2: The malicious Visual Studio solution HtaDotnet and corresponding “Test” project folder as seen through Windows Explorer. The names of the folders and files are suggestive of their functionalities The malware author then compiles their “Test” project Visual Studio in a default “Debug” configuration (Figure 3) and writes out Test.exe and Test.pdb to a subfolder (Figure 4). Figure 3: The Visual Studio output of a default compiling configuration Figure 4: Test.exe and Test.pdb are written to a default subfolder of the code project folder In the Test.pdb file (Figure 5) there are references to the original path for the source code files along with other binary information for use in debugging. Figure 5: Test.pdb contains binary debug information and references to the original source code files for use in debugging During the compilation, the linker program associates the PDB file with the built executable by adding an entry into the IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY specifying the type of the debug information. In this case, the debug type is CodeView and so the PDB path is embedded under IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_CODEVIEW portion of the file. This enables a debugger to locate the correct PDB file Test.pdb while debugging Test.exe. Figure 6: Test.exe as shown in the PEview utility, which easily parses out the PDB path from the IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_CODEVIEW section of the executable file PDB Path in CodeView Debug Information CodeView Structure The exact format of the debug information may vary depending on compiler and linker and the modernity of one’s software development tools. CodeView debug information is stored under IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_CODEVIEW in the following structure: Type Description DWORD ""RSDS"" header GUID 16-byte Globally Unique Identifier DWORD ""age"" (incrementing # of revisions) BYTE PDB path, null terminated Figure 7: Structure of CodeView debug directory information Full Versus Partial PDB Path There are generally two buckets of CodeView PDB paths, those that are fully qualified directory paths and those that are partially qualified , that specify the name of the PDB file only.

925,Long_Train,"There are numerous types of online advertising and associated ways to make money from it. One common distinction is between sponsored content and banner ads. Most users are familiar with banner ads as they tend to be somewhat isolated from the content of the webpage. Sponsored content, on the other hand, can appear on a page mixed in among the original content on the page. It typically will have some sort of identifier saying ""Sponsored Content"" and when a user clicks the link they are typically taken through the ad network to another site. Inside of each of these categories there are a wide variety of options for the advertiser. However, for the purposes of this blog we are going to focus on the area of online advertising that is the most ripe for abuse, real time bidding (RTB). Let's start by talking about the components of an RTB advertising network. The first piece is the publisher, who gets paid to host ads on their site. To host ads, the publisher utilizes an advertising server. There are several ad servers to choose from, including self-hosted or service solutions. Self-hosted ad server options include open-source and paid solutions. The second key portion of an RTB network is an open ad exchange. This is a public digital marketplace where the publisher posts their site's ad spots that are available for bidding. The third and final portion of a basic advertising chain are the advertisers. These advertisers can include marketing companies, individuals, or other ad networks. These groups then bid in real time on the ad real estate available on content being rendered. Now, let's walk through how exactly this works. When a random user requests a web page, the HTTP request is sent to the publisher and the bidding begins. The publisher leverages integrated code or their ad server to list the ads for bid via the advertising exchange. As part of the HTTP request and response, the publisher can gather additional information about the requestor, including things like demographics, URL, location, browser type, window size, and other identifiable pieces of information. All this information is then passed to the ad exchange where advertisers begin the bidding. The additional information provided by the publisher can allow the advertiser to target their ads more specifically and display only to those users that are likely to be engaged. The winning bid is then chosen and the advertiser provides the ad to the ad exchange. The ad exchange",0

Some parts of the campaign were briefly described by a Serbian security provider in 2016 and the Croatian CERT in 2017. Each of these sources focused only on one of the two tools and only on a single country. However, our research shows that there is a significant overlap in targets and also in the attackers’ tactics, techniques and procedures. Our findings show that the mentioned attacks have been orchestrated and we consider them a single long-term campaign that spans Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our research has also shed more light at the malware used in this campaign and provided some context. We’ve discovered a new version of BalkanDoor with a new method for execution/installation: an exploit of the WinRAR ACE vulnerability ( CVE-2018-20250 ). Furthermore, we’ve seen both malicious tools digitally signed with various certificates the developers paid for to add perceived legitimacy. One of them, issued to SLOW BEER LTD, was even valid at the time of writing; we’ve notified the issuer about the misuse and they revoked the certificate. In this article, we will describe some notable features of both BalkanDoor and BalkanRAT. Our analysis shows that the former runs as a Windows service, which allows it to unlock the Windows logon screen remotely and without the password or start a process with the highest possible privileges. The latter misuses a legitimate remote desktop software (RDS) product and uses extra tools and scripts to hide its presence from the victim, such as hiding the window, tray icon, process and so on. Targets and distribution Both BalkanRAT and BalkanDoor have been spread in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Based on our historical intelligence, we believe the XSLCmd backdoor is used by APT, including a group that we call “GREF.” We track this threat group as “GREF” due to their propensity to use a variety of Google references in their activities – some of which will be outlined later in this report.

Figure 1: CERT-Bund tweet from September 20, 2019 Machine translation of this tweet reads: “Watch out for online banking: Emotet reloads TrickBot. On infected PCs, TrickBot displays a query for the mobile phone number and the device type used for banking and then prompts users to install an alleged security app.” When banking Trojans ask for this type of information, it usually means the next step will be an attempt to infect the victim’s mobile device. Our team went ahead and hunted for samples of the app and analyzed it in our labs. In this analysis, we get into the capabilities of the new variant and what we found to be a “kill switch” that can eliminate the malware remotely from an infected device. Desktop Trojans and Their Mobile Component The process by which Trojans attempt to infect mobile devices is at least a decade old. Usually, when users are already infected with malware like TrickBot on their desktop, they will see a web injection asking for their mobile device operating system (OS)",1

Later in 2018, Unit 42 released a Bisonal paper where we can see a spear-phishing campaign in Russian and a decoy document alleged to be from Rostec, a Russian state-owned holding conglomerate headquartered in Moscow. Finally, in 2018, Ahnlab released a paper about ""Operation Bitter Biscuit"" where Bisonal was used against Korean and Japanese entities. India is also mentioned, but it was by another malware named ""Bioazih"" by Ahnlab. In this paper, the editor mentions targets such as manufacturers, defense industry and government. Additionally, we can provide additional decoy documents. For example, a Korean document used in September 2014 where the title was ""Contact member and counselor of the Agriculture, Forestry, Livestock, Food and Marine Fisheries Committee:"" Or a Russian document about the CIPR Digital conference used in April 2018. This is an application document that has been used to provide a decoy to the Bisonal malware. This conference has some high-ranking government and business attendees. In 2019, a Russian RTF document — судалгаа.doc (research.doc) — was used with an exploit to drop the winhelp.wll file, which contains Bisonal. Last year, we also identified multiple Korean decoy documents using similar RTF exploits to deliver Bisonal, namely ☆2020년도 예산안 운영위 서면질의 답변서_발간(1).doc (State Council Candidate (Minister of Justice Chumiae) Personnel Hearing Execution Plan (1) .doc) and 국무위원후보자(법무부장관 추미애) 인사청문회 실시계획서(1).doc (Written Inquiry from the 2020 Budget Operation Committee (Published) (1) .doc) which are both alleged government documents. Based on our research and the released paper mentioned above, the Bisonal malware is part of the Tonto Team arsenal. Tonto Team was mentioned in the media in 2017 as one of the actors who targeted South Korea, when the country announced it would deploy a Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) in response to North Korean missile tests. At this time, researchers connected the Tonto Team to China. 10 years of evolution Introduction The first variant of Bisonal publicly released went by the name of ""HeartBeat.""

This powerful backdoor can receive commands from the attackers, enabling it to exfiltrate files from the system it is running on, execute additional scripts, delete files, and more. While these methods have remained consistent over the years, intermediate stages of this attack have been added, changed and removed due to several security vendors now aware of MuddyWater’s tactics, techniques and procedures.

The new malware appears to be linked to the infamous Wolf Research organization and targets Android devices located in Thailand. How did it work? The malware mimics legit services such as Google service, GooglePlay or Flash update. The malware is not really advanced and is based on a lot of copy/paste from public sources available on the Internet. The C2 infrastructure contains a lack of sophistication such as open panels, reuse of old servers publicly tagged as malicious… So what? After being publicly denounced by CSIS Group — a threat intelligence company in Denmark — Wolf Research was closed and a new organization named LokD was created . This new organization seems to work on securing Android devices. However, thanks to the infrastructure sharing and forgotten panel names, we assess with high confidence that this actor is still active, it is still developing malware and has been using it from mid-June to today. On the C2 panel, we found a potential link between Wolf Research and another Cyprus organization named Coralco Tech. This organization is also working on interception technology. Links to Wolf Intelligence During the Virus Bulletin conference in 2018, CSIS researchers Benoît Ancel and Aleksejs Kuprins did a presentation on Wolf Research and the offensive arsenal developed by the organization.

Since Winnti is also a malware family, we always write “Winnti Group” when we refer to the malefactors behind the attacks. Since 2013, it has been demonstrated that Winnti is only one of the many malware families used by the Winnti Group. Attribution to the Winnti Group Multiple indicators led us to attribute this campaign to the Winnti Group. Some of the C&C domains used by PipeMon were used by Winnti malware in previous campaigns mentioned in our white paper on the Winnti Group arsenal . Besides, Winnti malware was also found in 2019 at some of the companies that were later compromised with PipeMon. In addition to Winnti malware, a custom AceHash (a credential harvester) binary found at other victims of the Winnti Group, and signed with a well-known stolen certificate used by the group (Wemade IO), was also used during this campaign. The certificate used to sign the PipeMon installer, modules and additional tools is linked to a video game company that was compromised in a supply-chain attack in late 2018 by the Winnti Group and was likely stolen at that time. Interestingly, PipeMon modules are installed in %SYSTEM32%\spool\prtprocs\x64\ ; this path was also used in the past to drop the second stage of the trojanized CCleaner . Additionally, compromising a software developer’s build environment to subsequently compromise legitimate application is a known modus operandi of the Winnti Group.

We had a statement from Baidu security team at the end of this blog. IOC correlation analysis Starting with the above domain name, we pivoted into our DNSmon graphic system and discovered more new threat nodes, especially, a set of key C2 IPs emerge. As can be seen from the partial IOC correlation diagram, almost all domain names are related to the two key IP addresses 125.124.255.20 and 125.124.255.79 . With these two IPs, Shuagnqiang campaign pointed a bunch of C2 DNS names to control and deliver malicious programs from late 2019.

Increase in User Interest of Coronavirus-related Topics Figure 1. Trend of users searching coronavirus related keywords Using Google Trends and our traffic logs, we observed a steep increase in user interest of topics related to coronavirus. In Figure 1, we can see how interested users are in coronavirus-related keywords based on Google Trends. In particular, we see three prominent peaks at the end of January, the end of February, and the middle of March 2020. The first peak aligns with the virus outbreak in China, the second peak signifies the first US case of unknown origin, and the third peak is at the same time as the virus outbreak in the US. One interesting exception in Figure 1 is alcohol, as users have an interest in it all year round, with a peak at Christmas. Intuitively, the year round interest in alcohol is for drinking it, however the peaks aligned with coronavirus are for medical alcohol. Figure 2. Trend of users visiting coronavirus related URLs Matching our observations about user interest from Google Trends, we see in Figure 2 a near ten-fold increase in the number of unique coronavirus-related URLs visited by our customers comparing early February to late March. The increased user interest in coronavirus presents a lucrative opportunity for cybercriminals to profit from this pandemic. A common method for crooks to benefit from trending topics is to register domain names that include related keywords, such as “coronavirus” or “COVID”.

Beyond that, the dropper used sophisticated techniques and many layers of obfuscation and evasion before even delivering the final malicious payload. There's another series of checks once the payload is delivered to ensure, with reasonable certainty, that the payload was only executed on systems located in Brazil and not that of a researcher or some other piece of security technology, most notably sandboxes. Beyond that, this malware uses novel techniques for command and control updates via YouTube, and a plethora of other techniques and methods, both new and old.

This will include a detailed walkthrough of deobfuscating the attack from the initial spam message, to the dropper mechanisms, and finally to all the evasion techniques astaroth has implemented. The goal is to give researchers the tools and knowledge to be able to analyze this in their own environments. This malware is as elusive as it gets and will likely continue to be a headache for both users and defenders for the foreseeable future. This will be especially true if its targeting moves outside of South America and Brazil. Technical details Astaroth features a multi-stage infection process that is used to retrieve and execute the malware. At a high level, the infection process is as follows.

Overview Nefilim emerged in March 2020 and shares a substantial portion of code with another ransomware family, NEMTY. The exact relationship between the actors behind NEMTY and Nefilim/Nephilim is less than clear. NEMTY launched in August of 2019 as a public affiliate program, and has since gone private.

More details on how the malware was delivered are described later in the blog. The choice of terminology in URL paths and file names when delivering BackConfig malware in this, and other campaigns discussed later on, is clearly to blend in as benign operations, paths and filenames. Although spelled differently, it could be easy to believe the payload relates to the DHCP networking service. The purpose of this malware is to allow the actors to download and execute an executable file, as well as download and run batch files to run commands on the end system. This sample has a custom “decryption” routine that subtracts six from each character. The following strings are decrypted using this method: linkrequest[.]live \\Adobe\\Driver\\dwg\\pid.txt \\Adobe\\Driver\\dwg\\ \\Adobe\\Driver\\dwg\\wuaupdt.exe The Trojan reads the following file to use in the URL of the C2 beacon. If the file does not exist, the executable will exit without performing any further activities. The pid.txt file is created during the earlier delivery and installation phases starting with the weaponized Excel document. More information about this setup process is covered later in the delivery section. As previously mentioned, this behavior makes an automated analysis of the individual executable payload component harder. %USERPROFILE%\Adobe\Driver\dwg\pid.txt The C2 channel uses HTTPS thanks to the INTERNET_FLAG_SECURE flag used when calling the HttpOpenRequestA function. The beacon HTTP request will look like the following: GET /orderme/ [contents of pid.txt file] HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0 @/NEW Host: linkrequest[.]live [resolving to 23.106.123[.]87] The Trojan will look for the following field and values within the HTTP response header: “Content-Type: application” “Content-Type: xDvsds” “Content-Type: Bw11eW” If the content-type field contains a value of application , the Trojan will extract a filename from the HTTP response headers between the string filename and Content-Transfer-Encoding . It will use this filename to create a file in the %USERPROFILE%\Adobe\Driver\dwg\ folder, which it will write the data in the HTTP response to. Based on the other two Content-Types , we believe the filename provided will be either “ wuaupdt.exe ” or test.bat . If the content-type field has a value of xDvsds , the Trojan",0

With the global impacts of COVID-19, an unprecedented number of corporations are expediating their cloud infrastructure migrations, all while transitioning to a largely remote workforce that is understandably interested in all topics related to the virus. Given this trend, it should come as no surprise that BEC actors are seizing opportunities to exploit the situation through tailored phishing campaigns related to COVID-19.

Use an EDR tool to give visibility and immediate response capabilities when high severity incidents are detected. Proactively hunt in your environment for sensitive assets periodically.

In 2018, 30% of the telecommunications providers reported sensitive customer information was stolen due to an attack. These telecommunications providers have been expanding in size, to the point where In the past thirteen years, mobile cellular phone subscribers have quadrupled in size and sit at 8 billion subscribers today . Due to their wide availability and the fundamental service they bring, telecommunications providers have become critical infrastructure for the majority of world powers. Ask the researchers questions about this attack during their live webinar. Much like telecommunication providers, many other critical infrastructure organizations provide a valuable targets for nation state threat actors , due to their high impact. In studies, nearly a quarter of critical infrastructure organizations reported they had been hit by nation state attacks and 60% said disruptive cyber attacks are among the threats they are most worried about. Threat actors, especially those at the level of nation state, are seeking opportunities to attack these organizations, conducting elaborate, advanced operations to gain leverage , seize strategic assets, and collect information . When successful, these attacks often have huge implications. Last year, we identified a threat actor that has been operating in telecommunications provider environments for at least two years. We performed a post-incident review of the attacks and were able to identify changes in the attack patterns along with new activity every quarter. The threat actor mainly sought to obtain CDR data (call logs, cell tower locations, etc.) belonging to specific individuals from various countries. This type of targeted cyber espionage is usually the work of nation state threat actors. We’ve concluded with a high level of certainty that",1

Let’s compare this recent Loader we found with the previous Loader that has been analyzed by MacKeeper in their blog : MacKeeper sample of a macOS Bundlore Loader, taken from https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/610-macos-bundlore-adware-analysis/ The MacKeeper sample above uses AES_256_CBC to decrypt a Python payload to ultimately execute it in a child process created via fork(). New macOS Bundlore sample detected by Confiant The recent version that we detected above does things differently. The AES decryption mechanism was replaced with 9 weird looking functions. Here’s a quick analysis: The overall execution process is the same as the previous version: The child process is created via fork() The previous pipe created by the parent process will be duplicated to STDIN via dup2(). ( Hence the xor ESI, ESI, which returns ESI=0, and 0 is the macro value of the STDIN file descriptor.) The default Python process will be created by the child process via execv() and will execute the data coming from STDIN (that should contains the hidden Python payload). Note: The pipe can be used by the creating process, as well as all its child processes, for reading and writing. One process can write to this “virtual file” or pipe and another related process can read from it. Looking at the 9 functions, it turns out they have the Python hidden payload stored via stackstrings! The stackstrings stored inside the 9 functions are long and scrambled which makes them virtually unreadable and adds a fair complexity to analysis. Here’s an example of the disassembly of function _funct0, one of the 9 functions in this Loader: _funct0 part1 _funct0 part2 _funct0 part3 _funct0 part4 _funct0 part5 We can see a call to write() that will actually write these stackstrings to the pipe . Note: The write() call is important to keep in mind for the rest of this blog Finally, dumping the Python code isn’t trivial as it was in the previous sample. The extraction and the analysis of these stackstrings are required to understand this Loader main purpose. Why stackstrings? Stackstrings is a technique that basically mixes code and data inside one executable. It is a common and",0

It utilizes a DLL loader to decrypt and execute an RC4-encrypted payload. Typically, the payload is the first-stage backdoor which receives and loads other executables from external attackers. These first-stage backdoors can be divided into two types: First, to connect to a command-and-control (C&C) server, and second, to listen in on a specific port. Sometimes, the hardcoded file paths of the encrypted payloads are not under Windows native directories (e.g., under security products or third-party libraries’ directories), which may indicate that the attackers might have prior knowledge of their targets’ environments. It is also possible that the attackers use Waterbear as a secondary payload to help maintain presence after gaining some levels of access to the targets’ systems. The evidence is that Waterbear frequently uses internal IPs as its own C&C servers (for instance, b9f3a3b9452a396c3ba0ce4a644dd2b7f494905e820e7b1c6dca2fdcce069361 uses an internal IP address of 10[.]0[.]0[.]211 as its C&C server).

It does this by taking the full path it was loaded from and appending a .dat extension to it. For example, if the malicious DLL is named LmiGuardianDLL.dll , the payload filename would be LmiGuardianDLL.dll.dat . The encrypted payload is read from disk and then AES-128 decrypted in CBC mode by the loader. The 16-byte initialization vector (IV) and symmetric key are hardcoded into the DLL and can vary from sample to sample. An example of a loader using hardcoded IV and Key is shown in Figure 2: Figure 2: Payload hardcoded decryption details The result of the decryption is the second stage payload, which is mapped into the loader process address space and executed. Second Stage – Installation and Persistence The second stage malware is primarily responsible for installing itself, setting up persistence, and spawning a new process to inject the third stage payload.

This blog will introduce a new reverse shell from FIN8, dubbed BADHATCH and compare publicly reported versions of ShellTea and PoSlurp to variants observed by Gigamon Applied Threat Research (ATR). With these comparisons, we aim to show how FIN8 continues to evolve and adapt their tooling. Our goal in sharing this intelligence is to enable defenders to better prevent, discover, or disrupt FIN8’s operations and offer a greater understanding of their capabilities. Evolving Toolsets Gigamon ATR, along with incident response partners, observed FIN8 on numerous occasions and on each occasion collected and analyzed malicious samples for detection research. We analyzed variants of the ShellTea implant and PoSlurp memory scraper malware, designated ShellTea.B and PoSlurp.B. One of the most interesting samples analyzed appears to be a previously unreported tool, BADHATCH, that provides file transfer and reverse shell functionality. As part of our research, Gigamon ATR reviewed previously reported samples when available, assessed public reports, and compared intelligence to our own observations from incident response engagements. Previous reporting on FIN8 indicates that initial infection typically begins with a malicious email campaign, using weaponized Microsoft Word document attachments aimed at enticing the user to enable macros. These macros execute a PowerShell command which downloads a second PowerShell script containing the shellcode of the first stage of a downloader, called PowerSniff by root9B and Unit 42 , or PUNCHBUGGY by FireEye . While Gigamon ATR does not have phishing",1

The last documented version of ShellTea was in 2017, in a POS malware attack . Given the nature of the industry targeted in the attack uncovered by Morphisec, we assume that this was also an attempted POS attack. As the attack was prevented by the Morphisec solution, the POS malware could not be downloaded to the machines. This is the first attack observed during 2019 that can be attributed to FIN8 with high probability, although there are a few indicators that overlap with known FIN7 attacks (URLs and infrastructure).

Also, the PlugX that Mustang Panda APT uses has some extra features, including spreading through USB, gathering information, and stealing documents in air-gaped networks via USB. Mustang Panda APT uses a package of binaries to load the actual payload and it is intentionally designed this way to bypass file scanners and sandboxes.

What sets Latin American banking trojans apart? Before moving further, let’s define the characteristics of this type of banking trojan: It is written in the Delphi programming language It contains backdoor functionality It uses long distribution chains It may divide its functionality into multiple components It usually abuses legitimate tools and software It targets Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking countries We have encountered other common characteristics during our research. Most Latin American banking trojans we have analyzed connect to the C&C server and stay connected, waiting for whatever commands the server sends. After receiving a command, they execute it and wait for the next one. The commands are probably pushed manually by the attacker. You can think of this approach as a chat room where all the members react to what the admin writes. The C&C server address seems to be the resource these malware authors protect the most. We have encountered many different approaches to hiding the actual address, which we will discuss in this series of blog posts. Besides the C&C server, a unique URL is used by the malware to submit victim identification information. This helps the attackers to keep track of their victims. Banking trojans from Latin America",1

This campaign also shows us that while network-based detection is important, it can be complemented with system behavior analysis and endpoint protections for additional layers of security. Analysis of Maldocs Initial Infection Vector This threat arrives on the endpoint in the form of malicious Microsoft Word documents. The malicious documents (maldocs) prompt the end-user for a password to view the contents of the maldocs. The malicious VB script in the maldocs is activated once the user enters the correct password for the document. The maldocs have been known to have seemingly benign file names in the wild such as: Company-Terms.doc DOT_JD_GM.doc [DOT_JD_GM may possibly stand for ""Department Of Telecommunications_Job Description_General Manager""] These file names indicate that the maldocs may be targeted towards specific individuals as part of a targeted distribution campaign. The initial infection vector of this threat is most likely email based with the body of the malicious email containing the password required to open the maldocs. Malicious VBA Analysis Once opened, the maldoc activates a malicious VBA script that performs the following malicious activities: Extracts the contents of a form/textbox. This content consists of an MS Windows binary embedded as a character representation of the binary's bytes delimited using a specific character (e.g. ""O"" used as a delimiter). Delimited Malicious MZ embedded in maldoc highlighted. The malicious binary is extracted from the maldoc by the VBA script and dropped on the endpoint to the location: C:\Users\Public\sgrmbrokr.doc The file is consequently renamed to an exe : C:\Users\Public\sgrmbrokr.exe The malicious VBScript then creates a shortcut in the currently logged in user's Start-Up directory to achieve persistence across reboots for the malicious executable (MZ) written to the file system in previous steps.

Cyber attacks are currently listed among the top offensive tools of a potential adversary along with such classic instruments as submarines or special operations (SpecOps) teams. The recent discussion of the Islamic Republic of Iran to retaliate digitally for the US takedown of General Soleimani concludes that kinetic and cyber offense currently exists within the same framework and one could be a substitute for another. This ability to efficiently integrate cyber offense measures into the actual battlefield of a traditional or asymmetric warfare model has been for years tested in the long-term military conflict unfolding in Eastern Ukraine since 2014. This confrontation revealed many characterful traits that may become intrinsic features of 21st-century warfare. Massive digital attacks on physical infrastructure, the alleged use of cyberattacks against field hardware including artillery and, of course, military reconnaissance via cyber espionage. The later tactics were employed by the Gamaredon group, a spyware collective that has been specifically targeting Ukrainian military and security institutions in order to compromise and survey the country’s national security (NatSec) resilience and military power.

The table below shows that QUADAGENT can transmit the most amount of data per query, as it has 60 characters within its subdomain to transmit base64 encoded data, meaning each query can transmit 45 (60*.75 = 45) bytes of data. The table also shows that the updated version of BONDUPDATER can download the most amount of bytes per query, as the C2 can provide 186.75 bytes of data thanks to the 255-byte maximum size for TXT queries and the C2 providing base64 encoded data after a 6 character sequence number ((255-6)*.75 = 186.75), which will be discussed later in this blog.

Throughput and encoding used by OilRig’s tools using DNS tunneling Another difference seen amongst the tools involves the type of DNS queries used to transmit and receive data, with each of the tools using DNS A, AAAA or TXT queries. Lastly, how the Trojan issues DNS queries differs as well. Depending on the tool, DNS queries could be issued using the built-in ‘nslookup’ application, using methods within the “UdpClient” class, using methods “GetHostByName” and “GetHostAddresses” from the ‘DNS’ class, or using the DnsQuery API functions within the ‘Dnsapi’ library. Table 2 includes the five tools covered in this blog, which shows several different DNS query types used for the tunneling protocol and different functions used by the tools to issue the DNS requests. Also, the example C2 domain column provides the domain name once used by OilRig to host a C2 server for the associated tool.

Helminth There are several variants of Helminth, as the OilRig actors actively developed this Trojan during the course of their attack campaigns. The Helminth Trojan came in two forms, a portable executable version and a PowerShell version, both of which received updates to their DNS tunneling protocol over time. The DNS tunneling protocols used in each variant operated the same way, but the developer would make changes to the generated subdomains to make them look visually different to evade detection. For instance, Figures 2, 3 and 4 below show the subdomain generation function used in three variants of PowerShell Helminth, which effectively generate the subdomains with the same structure, but the first two characters differ from “00”, “zz” and “ww”. While the portable executable and PowerShell variants of Helminth generate different subdomains for their DNS tunneling, in this section we will focus on the PowerShell variant as it is easier to visualize. function GetSub($myflag2, $cmdid='00', $partid='000'){if($myflag2 -eq 0){('00000000'+(convertTo-Base36(Get-Random -Maximum 46655)))}elseif($myflag2 -eq 1){('00'+$global:myid+'00000'+(convertTo-Base36(Get-Random -Maximum 46655)))}elseif($myflag2 -eq 2){('00'+$global:myid+$cmdid+$partid+(convertTo-Base36(Get-Random -Maximum 46655)))}} 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 function GetSub ( $ myflag2 , $ cmdid = '00' , $ partid = '000' ) { if ( $ myflag2 - eq 0 ) { ( '00000000' + ( convertTo - Base36 ( Get - Random - Maximum 46655 ) ) ) } elseif ( $ myflag2 - eq 1 ) { ( '00' + $ global : myid + '00000' + ( convertTo - Base36 ( Get - Random - Maximum 46655 ) ) ) } elseif ( $ myflag2 - eq 2 ) { ( '00' + $ global : myid + $ cmdid + $ partid + ( convertTo - Base36 ( Get - Random - Maximum 46655 ) ) ) } } Figure 2.

Upon initial execution, the malware generates a machine ID using the creation timestamp of either %SystemDrive%\pagefile.sys or %SystemDrive%\hiberfil.sys (whichever is identified first). Interestingly, the system drive is queried in a somewhat uncommon way, directly from the KUSER_SHARED_DATA structure (via SharedUserData→NtSystemRoot ). KUSER_SHARED_DATA is a structure located in a special part of kernel memory that is mapped into the memory space of all user-mode processes (thus shared), and always located at a fixed memory address (0x7ffe0000 , pointed to by the SharedUserData symbol). The code then looks for the current shell process by using a call to GetWindowThreadProcessId(GetShellWindow(), …) . The code also features a special check; if the checksum calculated from the name of the shell's parent process matches the checksum of explorer.exe ( 0xc3c07cf0 ), it will attempt to inject into the parent process instead. SAIGON then injects into this process using the classic VirtualAllocEx / WriteProcessMemory / CreateRemoteThread combination of functions. Once this process is injected, it loads two embedded files from within its binary: A PUBLIC.KEY file, which is used to verify and decrypt other embedded files and data coming from the malware's command and control (C2) server A RUN.PS1 file, which is a PowerShell loader script template that contains a "" @ [email protected] """,0

The Anchor malware is a backdoor used very selectively on high-profile targets, and appears to be tightly connected to TrickBot, potentially even authored by the same individuals who created TrickBot. While this blog does not discuss attribution explicitly, the nature of these attacks, specifically the motivation, some of the tools and techniques detailed, have certain resemblance to past attacks that were linked to the financially-motivated FIN6 threat actor, a group that is known to target POS systems and has been linked to TrickBot infections in the past. Lastly, our blog emphasizes the gravity and danger that lies in commodity malware infections, as they have the potential of escalating into a hacking operation. This can easily lead to a disastrous outcome, whether it be a ransomware infection or theft of sensitive financial data. Key Points The TrickBot-Anchor Operation: Cybereason Nocturnus is investigating a series of targeted attacks against financial, manufacturing, and retail businesses across the United States and Europe. Targets POS Systems: The attacks target POS systems to steal sensitive information by taking over critical assets in the victims’ network. Deploys A Backdoor on High-value Targets: On certain high-profile targets, the attackers selectively use a new variant of the rare Anchor_DNS tool. Anchor_DNS is a backdoor that uses the DNS protocol to stealthily communicate with C2 servers. Uses a New, Undocumented Malware : In addition to the new Anchor_DNS variant, the attackers use a completely new and previously undocumented malware dubbed Anchor. Anchor has been in operation since August 2018 and appears to be tightly related to TrickBot. Adds Enhancements to TrickBot: This attack adds a new and enhanced stealing module to TrickBot that focuses on stealing passwords from various products, including the KeePass password manager. Uses Known Tools for Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement: The majority of the initial interactive hacking operation uses the known tools Meterpreter , PowerShell Empire , and Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and lateral movement. Abuses the Trust of Certificate Authorities : Many of the payloads in the attacks are signed binaries, which demonstrates the ever-growing trend of signed threats that abuse the trust of certificate authorities to bypass detection.

For this campaign, the attacker chose to use a cloud provider (Google) with a good reputation to avoid URL blacklisting.

ESET researchers have tracked the distribution of Glupteba for the last seven years. We’ll give a brief overview of its evolution. Back in 2011, ESET researchers working on the infamous TDL-4 bootkit discovered that, as explained in this blogpost , it was being used as a downloader to fetch additional malware. Glupteba was found to be one of many malware variants it installed. TDL-4 operators were most likely selling a distribution service on black markets. Three years later, ESET’s investigation into Operation Windigo revealed that part of the attackers’ infrastructure of compromised Linux servers was used to redirect a certain proportion of HTTP requests through trojanized instances of web servers (Apache httpd, lighttpd and nginx).

While digging through some recent spam campaigns that we have detected, it came to our attention that there was some unexpected usage of the C# compiler from the command line, as reported by our sandbox analysis (shown in Figure 1). Further investigation revealed that all these samples shared a common template and belonged to the same campaign: a spam wave distributing malicious RTF documents that acted as downloaders for well-known infostealers, such as Agent Tesla or LokiBot. Although not particularly advanced, the spam campaign leveraged a few interesting social-engineering tricks and infection techniques aimed at maximizing its infection rate.

The Mimikatz variant uploaded to these two organizations is unique, as it involves a seemingly custom loader application written in .NET. Therefore, we believe that the same threat group is behind both intrusions. Back in April 2019, we first observed the Emissary Panda threat group exploiting CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells on SharePoint servers at government organizations in two Middle Eastern countries. Fast forward five months to the current attacks and we see exploitation of the same vulnerability at government organizations in two different countries compared to the April attacks. We do not have any strong ties to connect the current attacks exploiting this vulnerability in SharePoint with the Emissary Panda attacks carried out in April. The overlaps between these two sets of attacks include exploitation of a common vulnerability, similar toolset and a shared government victimology, but no strong pivot points to connect these attack campaigns together. The exploitation of this vulnerability is not unique to Emissary Panda, as multiple threat groups are using this vulnerability to exploit SharePoint servers to gain initial access to targeted networks.

ESET researchers have been following the activity of the APT group utilizing BlackEnergy both before and after this milestone event. After the 2015 blackout, the group seemed to have ceased actively using BlackEnergy, and evolved into what we call TeleBots .

For example, enterprises running business applications are recommended to use a commercial Docker Enterprise solution that has a precise, role-based access control settings that only allow authenticated use of the API. In our research, the exposure of the Docker API ports was a result of misconfiguration on the user’s part, as we found that the misconfigurations were manually set up at the administrator level.

While the malware’s screen capturing and keylogging capabilities are set to ‘on’ by default, the recording feature requires an activation command from the C&C at intervals defined by the operator. Once activated, Micropsia begins recording using Win32 MCI (Media Control Interface), which provides a generic interface to nearly every kind of multimedia device. Initiating a new recording or stopping a running one is accomplished by calling Winmm . mciSendString API. That controls the multimedia device. Micropsia operators control the recording duration via Delphi timers that allow it to perform a periodic recording. A new recording is initiated by executing the above API using the following string commands. In the same way, stopping the recording and saving it to a file is achieved by executing the following. USB Flash Drives for Document Stealing Controlled by Micropsia operators, the malware is able to register to an event of USB volume insertion to detect new connected USB flash drives. This functionality is detailed in an old blog post . Once an event is triggered, Micropsia executes an RAR tool to recursively archive files based on a predefined list of file extensions (*.xls, *.xlsx, *.csv, *.odt, *.doc, *.docx, *.ppt, *.pptx, *.pdf, *.mdb, *.accdb, *.accde, *.txt).

It came to light in 2008, when Turla breached the US Department of Defense [1].

Organizations can protect themselves against Xbash by: Using strong, non-default passwords Keeping up-to-date on security updates Implementing endpoint security on Microsoft Windows AND Linux systems Preventing access to unknown hosts on the internet (to prevent access to command and control servers) Implementing and maintaining rigorous and effective backup and restoration processes and procedures. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat as outlined at the end of this blog. Below are some more specifics on Xbash’s capabilities: It combines botnet, coinmining, ransomware and self-propagation. It targets Linux-based for its ransomware and botnet capabilities. It targets Microsoft Windows-based systems for its coinmining and self-propagating capabilities. The ransomware component targets and deletes Linux-based databases. To date, we have observed 48 incoming transactions to these wallets with total income of about 0.964 bitcoins meaning 48 victims have paid about US$6,000 total (at the time of this writing). However, as see no evidence that the paid ransoms have resulted in recovery for the victims. In fact, we can find no evidence of any functionality that makes recovery possible through ransom payment. Our analysis shows this is likely the work of the Iron group, a group publicly linked to other ransomware campaigns including those that use the Remote Control System (RCS), whose source code was believed to be stolen from the HackingTeam",1

As of early June 2018, the server hosted 112 files in a subdirectory that could be accessed through a public web shell planted by the attackers. In addition to malware and tools, the served files also included uploads of log files seemingly originating from vulnerability scans and post-compromise tools. The web shell is a modification of the PhpSpy backdoor and references the author MagicCoder while linking to the (deleted) domain magiccoder.ir. Researching the hacker handle MagicCoder results in references to the Iranian hacking forum Ashiyane as well as defacements by the Iranian hacker group Sun Army. Targets During the investigation of the Leafminer group, we were able to assemble a targeting profile from different sources including telemetry and log files hosted publicly on the attacker’s arsenal server.

The de facto implementation, bundled in almost all Linux distributions, is the portable version of OpenSSH . A popular method used by attackers to maintain persistence on compromised Linux servers is to backdoor the OpenSSH server and client already installed. There are several reasons why creating malware based on OpenSSH is popular: It doesn’t require a new TCP port to be opened on the compromised machine.

Unlike the dozens of short-lived, mass attacks monitored in our network of sensors (GGSN), Butter originates from a very limited number of attack sources and keeps them alive without being caught due to its low and slow operation. In July of this year, Butter released a new payload that has gone undetected by many security products and has convinced us to release this post. Butter executes a brute force SSH attack and on every breached Linux machine leaves a backdoor user named butter, together with a Trojan registered as a service.

OilRig’s Testing Activities While investigating recent attacks performed by the threat actor group OilRig using their new Bondupdater version , Unit 42 researchers searched for additional Microsoft Office documents used by OilRig hoping to locate additional malware being used in other attacks during the same time period. We focused on the functionality and pivoting off the original OilRig Microsoft documents found during our recent investigation. Unit 42 researchers found 11 additional samples that were submitted across several public anti-virus testing sites, as seen in Table 1. These samples appeared to have been created by OilRig during their development and testing activities, all of which share many similarities with the delivery document used in the recent OilRig attack against a Middle Eastern government, N56.15.doc (7cbad6b3f505a199d6766a86b41ed23786bbb99dab9cae6c18936afdc2512f00) that we have also included in Table 1. During this testing, we saw document filenames that contain the C2 we witnessed in the targeted attack above, specifically the filenames XLS-withyourface.xls and XLS-withyourface – test.xls.

1147,Long_Train,"a Middle Eastern government leveraging an updated version of the BONDUPDATER malware, which now includes the ability to use TXT records within its DNS tunneling protocol for its C2 communications. A New Series of Attacks In mid-August, the Oilrig threat group sent what appeared to be a highly targeted phishing email to a high-ranking office in a Middle Eastern nation. The email had no subject and what initially drew our attention to this attack was the content of the spear phishing email. Figure 1. Spear phishing email sent by the Oilrig threat group Attached to the email was a malicious document named “N56.15.doc” (SHA256: 7cbad6b3f505a199d6766a86b41ed23786bbb99dab9cae6c18936afdc2512f00) which contained a macro that attempted to install a new version of the BONDUPDATER Trojan. Figure 2. Microsoft Word document with embedded macros and PowerShell Updated BONDUPDATER The spear-phishing email had an attached Microsoft Word document that contained a macro responsible for installing a new variant of BONDUPDATER. The macro begins this installation process by creating two files on the system at the following location: C:\ProgramData\WindowsAppPool\AppPool.vbs (SHA256: c0018a2e36c7ef8aa15b81001a19c4127ad7cd21ae410c1f854e5dadfa98b322) C:\ProgramData\WindowsAppPool\AppPool.ps1 (SHA256: d5c1822a36f2e7107d0d4c005c26978d00bcb34a587bd9ccf11ae7761ec73fb7) The macro finishes by running the dropped VBScript “AppPool.vbs” file by running “wscript C:\ProgramData\WindowsAppPool\AppPool.vbs”.

1157,Long_Train,"GhostDNS campaign , we believe that Novidade is not limited to a single campaign, as the exploit kit was also concurrently being used in different campaigns. One possibility is that the exploit kit tool was either sold to multiple groups or the source code was leaked, allowing threat actors to use the kit or create their own variations. Most of the campaigns we discovered used phishing attacks to retrieve banking credentials in Brazil. However, we also recently found campaigns with no specific target geolocation, suggesting that either the attackers are expanding their target areas, or a larger number of threat actors are using it. We named the exploit kit Novidade, which means “novelty” in Portuguese, due to the title string “Novidade!” on the webpages of all the current variants. Infection Chain Figure 1.

In addition, the malware can log in to the attacker’s email inbox, parse emails in a special folder for commands and save any payloads to a device from email attachments. This particular operation has been active since approximately May 2016 up to the present time. Infection vector and victims While looking for the infection vector, we found no evidence of spear phishing or any of the other common vectors. But some clues, such as the existence of a hidden menu for operator control, point to a manual installation method – the attackers used physical access to a victim’s device to install the malware. This would explain the number of victims – there are less than 10 of them and according to our detection statistics, they are all located in the Russia. Intrigued, we continued our search and found more interesting clues that could reveal some detailed information about the owners of the infected devices. Several TXT files with commands on the attacker’s FTP server contain a victim identifier in the names that was probably added by the criminals: CMDS10114- Sun1 .txt CMDS10134- Ju_ASUS .txt CMDS10134- Tad .txt CMDS10166- Jana .txt CMDS10187-",0

The user is then redirected to a Facebook API to generate an access token that will also be sent to the C2 if successful. Facebook Propagation Authenticated users’ Facebook access tokens are generated and the propagation phase begins. The malware collects relevant account information for the purpose of spreading the malicious link to the user’s network. The C2 path “/php3/doms.php” is accessed and returns a random URI. For example: This link is distributed one of two ways: as a message via Facebook Messenger or as a new post that includes tags for up to 50 contacts. Once the victim clicks on the link, the infection process starts over again and redirects them to a YouTube-like webpage that requires a “plugin installation” to view the video.

The attackers are using a publicly available browser-mining tool to get the infected machines to start mining cryptocurrencies. The JavaScript code is downloaded from external sites that the group controls and contains the mining pool. Radware observed that in the last several days the group was trying to mine three different coins (Monero, Bytecoin and Electroneum) that are all based on the “CryptoNight” algorithm that allows mining via any CPU. The pools Radware has witnessed are: • supportxmr.com – 46uYXvbapq6USyzybSCQTHKqWrhjEk5XyLaA4RKhcgd3WNpHVXNxFFbXQYETJox6C5Qzu8yiaxeXkAaQVZEX2BdCKxThKWA • eu.bytecoin-pool.org – 241yb51LFEuR4LVWXvLdFs4hGEuFXZEAY56RB11aS6LXXG1MEKAiW13J6xZd4NfiSyUg9rbERYpZ7NCk5rptBMFE5uZEinQ • etn.nanopool.org – etnk7ivXzujEHf1qXYfNZiczo4ohA4Rz8Fv4Yfc8c5cU1SRYWHVry7Jfq6XnqP5EcL1LiehpE3UzD3MBfAxnJfvh3gksNp3suN At the time of writing, approximately $1,000 was mined over six days, mostly from the Monero pool. Figure 6: Cryptomining Persistency The malware uses numerous techniques to stay persistent on the machine and to ensure its activities on Facebook are persistent. 1. If the user tries to open the extensions tab to remove the extension, the malware closes it and prevents removal. 2. The malware downloads URI Regex from the C2 and blocks users that try to access those patterns.

1169,Long_Train,"an anti-virus (AV) package. We are unsure of the particular exploit used in any given case, but most devices targeted, particularly in older versions, have known public exploits or default credentials that make compromise relatively straightforward. All of this has contributed to the quiet growth of this threat since at least 2016. This post provides the technical findings you would normally see in a Talos blog. In addition, we will detail some thoughts on the tradecraft behind this threat, using our findings and the background of our analysts, to discuss the possible thought process and decisions made by the actor. We will also discuss how to defend against this threat and how to handle a device that may be infected. Finally, we will share the IOCs that we have observed to this point, although we are confident there are more that we have not seen. Brief technical breakdown The VPNFilter malware is a multi-stage, modular platform with versatile capabilities to support both intelligence-collection and destructive cyber attack operations. The stage 1 malware persists through a reboot, which sets it apart from most other malware that targets internet-of-things devices because malware normally does not survive a reboot of the device. The main purpose of stage 1 is to gain a persistent foothold and enable the deployment of the stage 2 malware. Stage 1 utilizes multiple redundant command and control (C2) mechanisms to discover the IP address of the current stage 2 deployment server, making this malware extremely robust and capable of dealing with unpredictable C2 infrastructure changes. The stage 2 malware, which does not persist through a reboot, possesses capabilities that we have come to expect in a workhorse intelligence-collection platform, such as file collection, command execution, data exfiltration and device management. However, some versions of stage 2 also possess a self-destruct capability that overwrites a critical portion of the device's firmware and reboots the device, rendering it unusable. Based on the actor's demonstrated knowledge of these devices, and the existing capability in some stage 2 versions, we assess with high confidence that the actor could deploy this self-destruct command to most devices that it controls, regardless of whether the command is built into the stage 2 malware. In addition, there are multiple stage 3 modules that serve as plugins for the stage 2 malware. These plugins provide stage 2 with additional functionality. As of this writing, we are aware",0

In addition to the large number of Zebrocy attacks we discovered, we also observed instances of the Sofacy group leveraging the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) exploit technique previously documented by McAfee. The instances we observed, however, used the DDE exploit to deliver different payloads than what was observed previously. In one instance the DDE attack was used to deliver and install Zebrocy. In another instance, the DDE attack was used to deliver an open-source penetration testing toolkit called Koadic . The Sofacy group has leveraged open source or freely available tools and exploits in the past but this is the first time that Unit 42 has observed them leveraging the Koadic toolkit. Links to previous attacks In our February report, we discovered the Sofacy group using Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros to deliver the SofacyCarberp payload to multiple government entities. In that report, we documented our observation that the Sofacy group appeared to use conventional obfuscation techniques to mask their infrastructure attribution by using random registrant and service provider information for each of their attacks. In particular, we noted that the Sofacy group deployed a webpage on each of the domains. This is odd because attackers almost never set up an actual webpage on adversary C2 infrastructure.

Several weeks ago, we identified the use of the latest version of this RAT (Remote Access Tool). In this article, we will discuss the technical capabilities, the evolution, development and potential attribution of what we are calling GravityRAT. GravityRAT has been under ongoing development for at least 18 months, during which the developer has implemented new features. We've seen file exfiltration, remote command execution capability and anti-vm techniques added throughout the life of GravityRAT. This consistent evolution beyond standard remote code execution is concerning because it shows determination and innovation by the actor. Throughout our investigation, we observed several malicious documents used to attack victims, which we will discuss. These malicious documents were used by the developer to run several tests on the popular analysis platform VirusTotal. Using VirusTotal allowed the developer to make changes in an attempt to decrease antivirus detection. Although GravityRAT has not been previously published or discussed, there was some information from the National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of India describing GravityRAT as being used in targeted attacks against India . Finally, we will discuss specific attribution elements discovered during our research into GravityRAT as we identify specific information, which we believe to be leaked by the developer, such as location, and potentially their first name.

The details we are releasing are to provide insight into attack methodologies being employed by sophisticated groups such as FIN7 who are consistently changing techniques between attacks to avoid detection, and to demonstrate the detection capabilities of the AMP for Endpoints and Threat Grid product lines. This is relevant to the constantly changing threats that are affecting multiple types of industries on a daily basis.

APT34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools, often conducting spear phishing operations using compromised accounts, sometimes coupled with social engineering tactics. In May 2016, we published a blog detailing a spear phishing campaign targeting banks in the Middle East region that used macro-enabled attachments to distribute POWBAT malware. We now attribute that campaign to APT34. In July 2017, we observed APT34 targeting a Middle East organization using a PowerShell-based backdoor that we call POWRUNER and a downloader with domain generation algorithm functionality that we call BONDUPDATER, based on strings within the malware. The backdoor was delivered via a malicious .rtf file that exploited CVE-2017-0199 .

Linking the attacks Building on our previous research into KHRAT Trojan , we have been monitoring KHRAT command and control domains. In February 2018, several KHRAT associated domains began resolving to the IP address 89.46.222[.]97. We made this IP the center of our investigation. Examining passive DNS (pDNS) records from PassiveTotal revealed several domain names associated with this IP that mimic popular technology companies. One of these domains, facebook-apps[.]com, was identified in one of the malware samples associated with this IP address. The following table depicts the two malware samples that are directly related to this IP address: SHA256 Description Connection to IP 0bb20a9570a9b1e3a72203951268ffe83af6dcae7342a790fe195a2ef109d855 Loader C2 facebook-apps.com (resolves to 89.46.222.97) c35609822e6239934606a99cb3dbc925f4768f0b0654d6a2adc35eca473c505d PLAINTEE Hosted on 89.46.222.97 Digging in further, the malware family we later named “PLAINTEE” appears to be quite unique with only six samples present in our data set.

We also address the financial aspects of the campaign and illustrate how, through tracking the money trail, Ryuk’s authors seem to want to disguise their received payments by dividing and transferring them among multiple wallets. An Overview of Ryuk Unlike the common ransomware, systematically distributed via massive spam campaigns and exploit kits, Ryuk is used exclusively for tailored attacks. In fact, its encryption scheme is intentionally built for small-scale operations, such that only crucial assets and resources are infected in each targeted network with its infection and distribution carried out manually by the attackers. This, of course, means extensive network mapping, hacking and credential collection is required and takes place prior to each operation. Its alleged attribution to Lazarus Group, discussed later in this post, may imply that the attackers are already well experienced in the targeted attacks domain, as seen by attacks such as the breach of Sony Pictures in 2014. Ryuk’s Ransom Note While no differences were found in the collected samples, two versions of ransom notes were sent to victims; a longer, well-worded and nicely phrased note, which led to the highest recorded payment of 50 BTC (around $320,000), and a shorter, more blunt note, which was sent to various other organizations and also led to some fine ransom payments ranging between 15-35 BTC (up to $224,000).

Within Cisco's Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) telemetry, we have observed several instances of attempts to install this RAT on various endpoints. As described below, we have also seen multiple malware campaigns distributing Remcos, with many of these campaigns using different methods to avoid detection. To help people who became victims of a harmful use of Remcos, Talos is providing a decoder script that can extract the C2 server addresses and other information from the Remcos binary. Please see the Technical Details section below for more information. Technical Details Remcos distribution in the wild Talos has observed several malware campaigns attempting to spread Remcos to various victims. Since Remcos is advertised and sold on numerous hacking-related forums, we believe it is likely that multiple unrelated actors are leveraging this malware in their attacks using a variety of different methods to infect systems. Earlier this year, RiskIQ published a report regarding an attacker who was reportedly targeting defense contractors in Turkey. Since then, this threat actor has continued to operate and has been observed targeting specific types of organizations. Talos has confirmed that in addition to defense contractors, this attacker has also targeted other organizations such as: International news agencies; Diesel equipment manufacturers and service providers operating within the maritime and energy sector; and HVAC service providers operating within the energy sector. In all of the observed campaigns, the attack begins with specially crafted spear phishing emails written in Turkish. The emails appear as if they were sent from a Turkish government agency and purport to be related to tax reporting for the victim's organization. Below is an",1

1212,Long_Train,"past two years. The campaigns, which we are collectively naming RedAlpha, combine light reconnaissance, selective targeting, and diverse malicious tooling. We discovered this activity as the result of pivoting off of a new malware sample observed targeting the Tibetan community based in India. Insikt Group’s analysis of infrastructure overlap among the new campaigns reveals wider targeting of the Chinese “Five Poisons, 2 ” in addition to South and Southeast Asian governments. Based on the campaign’s targeting of “Five Poisons”-related organizations, overlapping infrastructure, and links to malware used by other Chinese APTs uncovered during our research, we assess with medium confidence that the RedAlpha campaigns were conducted by a Chinese APT. Key Judgements The two newly discovered RedAlpha campaigns targeting the Tibetan community took place in 2017 and 2018. For ease of reference, we’ll call them the “2017 hktechy” and “2018 internetdocss” campaigns, after their command-and-control (C2) servers. Attacker tradecraft evolved from bespoke malware consisting of a custom dropper and the NetHelp infostealer implant in 2017 to a custom validator and njRAT commodity malware in 2018. The 2018 internetdocss campaign also leveraged scaled-down infrastructure to possibly reduce the impact of discovery and avoid the loss of proprietary tools and costly to maintain infrastructure. Both campaigns involved the use of payloads configured with several C2 servers; however, malware from both campaigns made use of the doc.internetdocss[.]com C2 domain, thus tying both campaigns together. A malicious Microsoft Word document that exploited CVE-2017-0199 was also used during the RedAlpha campaigns. This sample was first seen in the wild during the 57-day CNNVD vulnerability publication lag highlighted by previous Recorded Future research, further supporting the theory that the delay in publication by CNNVD was to enable Chinese threat actors to operationalize the exploit. Interesting connections to previous activity include the historic use of FF-RAT and common infrastructure used by NetTraveler, Icefog, and DeputyDog APTs, as well as the MILE TEA campaign. Background For many years, Tibetan and Uyghur communities have been targeted by many threat actors via exploits , phishing , watering hole attacks , and malware exploiting multiple platforms, including Windows , MacOS , and more recently, Android . Unsurprisingly, the attackers include multiple Chinese threat actors, among them the original Winnti group , LuckyCat , and NetTraveler , but also others like MiniDuke and Equation Group . Aiding targeted communities allows researchers to discover emerging malicious campaigns while protecting victims, but recurring discovery has done little to ultimately deter attackers. The RedAlpha campaigns began in mid-2017 by targeting the Tibetan community in India. The latest campaign remains ongoing, with new subdomains registered in late April 2018. The threat actor utilized a careful combination of victim reconnaissance and fingerprinting, followed by selective targeting with multi-stage malware. The malware utilized changed",1

One of the most interesting questions we still have is regarding attribution — and who is behind this malware. Previously, we published several articles concerning Group123 ( here , here , here, here and here ). We currently assess with medium confidence that this campaign and NavRAT are linked to Group123. Malicious Document Decoy Document The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing the HWP document named ""미북 정상회담 전망 및 대비.hwp"" (Prospects for US-North Korea Summit .hwp). This references a legitimate event that could potentially take place on June 12 . Here is a screenshot of the document: This document explains concerns prior to the summit between the U.S. and North Korea, which is expected to focus on the topic of denuclearization. The summit is the latest in a line of signs of diplomatic outreach from North Korea, following the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula between South Korea and North Korea on April 27, 2018.

In cases where the cybercriminals need additional data or capabilities after infecting a system, such as privilege escalation and obtaining local administrator privileges, the theft of user authentication data for financial software and services, or Windows accounts for lateral movement, the attackers download an additional pack of malware to the system, which is specifically tailored to the attack on each individual victim. The malware pack can include spyware, additional remote administration utilities that extend the attackers’ control on infected systems, malware for exploiting operating system and application software vulnerabilities, as well as the Mimikatz utility, which provides the attackers with Windows account data. Apparently, among other methods, the attackers obtain the information they need to perpetrate their criminal activity by analyzing the correspondence of employees at the enterprises attacked. They may also use the information found in these emails to prepare new attacks – against companies that partner with the current victim. Clearly, on top of the financial losses, these attacks result in leaks of the victim organizations’ sensitive data. Phishing emails In most cases, the phishing emails have finance-related content; the names of attachments also point to their connection with finance.

This started the malware-downloading chain, down to the final Smoke Loader infection and its plugins. Smoke Loader is primarily used as a downloader to drop and execute additional malware like ransomware or cryptocurrency miners. Actors using Smoke Loader botnets have posted on malware forums attempting to sell third-party payload installs. This sample of Smoke Loader did not transfer any additional executables, suggesting that it may not be as popular as it once was, or it’s only being used for private purposes. The plugins are all designed to steal sensitive information from the victim, specifically targeting stored credentials or sensitive information transferred over a browser — including Windows and Team Viewer credentials, email logins, and others. Technical details Infection Chain As mentioned above, the infection chain started with an email and an attached malicious Word document ( b98abdbdb85655c64617bb6515df23062ec184fe88d2d6a898b998276a906ebc ).

The purpose of the BOptions sideloading technique is to inject a dynamic library in the application. The malicious code inserted into these apps is capable of collecting and exfiltrating information from the device, such as the phone number, serial number, location, contacts, user's photos, SMS and Telegram and WhatsApp chat messages. Such information can be used to manipulate a victim or even use it for blackmail or bribery. Thanks to the logs located on the MDM servers and the malware's command and control (C2) server, we were able to determine that the malware has been in use since August 2015. The campaign targeted only a few select devices (13) that are all located in India. The attacker left essential data on the servers, such as emails and usernames. As part of the attacker's development and testing it appears that they compromised their device — we observed a device named ""test"" or ""mdmdev."" The log files we identified contain the phone number of the device. The number originates from India and uses the ""Vodafone India"" network with roaming capability disabled. With all of this information in mind, we assume with high confidence that the malware author works out of India. MDM is becoming more popular throughout large enterprises, and users should be aware that installing additional certificates on their device to allow remote management can result in potential malicious activity.

Also covered is the tangential discovery of some Gafgyt samples incorporating new Layer 7 DDoS functionality targeting a known DDoS-protection provider. IOCs for different campaigns, if not mentioned under the corresponding section, can be found at the end of this blog post.

During this ongoing analysis, we also looked into other potential indicators that would point us toward the actor. We discovered this Bellingcat article that potentially links this actor to one they dubbed ""Bahamut,"" an advanced actor who was previously targeting Android devices. Bahamut shared a domain name with one of the malicious iOS applications mentioned in our previous post. There was also a separate post from Amnesty International discussing a similar actor that used similar spear-phishing techniques to Bahamut. However, Cisco Talos did not find any spear phishing associated with this campaign. We will discuss some links and potential overlapping with these campaigns below. New MDM Technical information about the MDM Talos identified a third MDM server that we believe was used by this actor: ios-update-whatsapp[.]com. The first relevant difference between this MDM and the MDM we discussed in the previous article is the fact that the attackers patched the open-source project mdm-server — a small iOS MDM server.

It is essential to be aware of these attacks as emails look legitimate, but can result in the installation of a payload that can inflict significant financial damage to the targeted organization. Infection vector — Emails All observed attacks start with an email message, containing either a malicious attachment or a URL which leads to the first stage of the attack. The text of the emails is likely taken from legitimate email, such as mailing lists that targeted organisations may be subscribed to. Below are three examples, with the first one purporting to be sent by the European Banking Federation and is using a newly registered domain for the spoofed sender email address. The attachment is a malicious PDF file that entices the user to click on a URL to download and open a weaponized RTF file containing exploits for CVE-2017-11882 , CVE-2017-8570 and CVE-2018-8174 .

This type of feature is normally used for promotional campaigns or other forms of automated systems. We believe the attackers might similarly be using this service to automate the process of sending malicious SMS and WhatsApp messages to deliver malware. The message was clearly an attempt to trick our colleague into clicking on the link, which pointed to a domain name akhbar-arabia[.]com . As we will describe later in this report, we discovered this domain to belong to a large network infrastructure that has been previously documented to be connected to the Israeli surveillance vendor, NSO Group .

These messages carried links to domains which we identified as part of that same network infrastructure used by NSO Group or its customers to deliver exploits and malware designed to silently harvest data from the victims’ phones.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert about this activity on Jan. 24 2019, warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization's domain names. In the Sea Turtle campaign, Talos was able to identify two distinct groups of victims. The first group, we identify as primary victims, includes national security organizations, ministries of foreign affairs, and prominent energy organizations. The threat actor targeted third-party entities that provide services to these primary entities to obtain access. Targets that fall into the secondary victim category include numerous DNS registrars, telecommunication companies, and internet service providers. One of the most notable aspects of this campaign was how they were able to perform DNS hijacking of their primary victims by first targeting these third-party entities. We assess with high confidence that these operations are distinctly different and independent from the operations performed by DNSpionage, which we reported on in November 2018. The Sea Turtle campaign almost certainly poses a more severe threat than DNSpionage given the actor's methodology in targeting various DNS registrars and registries. The level of access we presume necessary to engage in DNS hijacking successfully indicates an ongoing, high degree of threat to organizations in the targeted regions. Due to the effectiveness of this approach, we encourage all organizations, globally, to ensure they have taken steps to minimize the possibility of malicious actors duplicating this attack methodology. The threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign show clear signs of being highly capable and brazen in their endeavors. The actors are responsible for the first publicly confirmed case against an organizations that manages a root server zone, highlighting the attacker's sophistication.

The Delivery Our research into the Aggah campaign began with a delivery document sent to organizations in a single Middle Eastern country via an email on March 27, 2019. This email appeared to originate from a large financial institution in the same country, although it was likely spoofed. The subject of the email was “Your account is locked.” This initial delivery document was sent to organizations in one Middle Eastern country, specifically to organizations in the education, media/marketing, and government verticals. Four days later on March 31, we saw the same delivery email sent to a financial organization in a second Middle Eastern country. We later discovered that this delivery document was just one of many in a larger campaign sent to organizations in the United States, Europe and Asia targeting the same verticals as in the Middle East as well as Technology, Retail, Manufacturing, State/Local Government, Hospitality, Medical, Technology, and other Professional business. The related documents were functionally similar, so we will describe the original sample we analyzed. The email sent on March 27 had a Word document attached with the filename “Activity.doc” (SHA256: d7c92a8aa03478155de6813c35e84727ac9d383e27ba751d833e5efba3d77946 ) that attempted to load a remote OLE document via Template Injection .

DNSpionage update New infection document, same macro In our previous post concerning DNSpionage, we showed that the malware author used malicious macros embedded in a Microsoft Word document. In the new sample from Lebanon identified at the end of February, the attacker used an Excel document with a similar macro: Instead of using the .oracleServices directory, which we had previously observed, the attacker uses a .msdonedrive directory and renames the malware ""taskwin32.exe."" The scheduled task was also renamed to ""onedrive updater v10.12.5."" Payload Overview This new sample is similar to the previous version disclosed in our previous post. The malware supports HTTP and DNS communication to the C2 server. The HTTP communication is hidden in the comments in the HTML code. This time, however, the C2 server mimics the GitHub platform instead of Wikipedia. While the DNS communication follows the same method we described in our previous article, the developer added some new features in this latest version and, this time, the actor removed the debug mode.

This confirms the actors are using Poison Ivy as part of their toolkit, something speculated in the original Trend Micro report but not confirmed by them. Further analysis uncovered a handful of ties indicating the actors may also be using the PCShare malware family, which has not been previously tied to the group. Figure 1 shows the spear phishing email which was sent to the Secretary General of Executive Yuan. The email is spoofed so that it appears as though it was sent from a staff member at the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Figure 1. Spear-phishing email with malicious attachment.

The malware hosted on the infrastructure includes five families of banking Trojans, two families of ransomware, and three information stealers. Multiple malware families were staged on the same web servers and subsequently distributed through mass phishing campaigns. The reuse of the servers to host different malware indicates the involvement of a common entity in the activities of the different malware operators.

Google Play has removed the apps and they stated that ""thanks to enhanced detection models, Google Play Protect will now be able to better detect future variants of these applications"" . While Google did not share with us the total number of infected devices, they confirmed that one of these malicious apps collected over 350 installations through the Play Store, while other variants collected few dozens each, and that all infections were located in Italy. We have directly observed multiple copies of Exodus with more than 50 installs and we can estimate the total number of infections to amount in the several hundreds, if not a thousand or more . Stage 1: Exodus One The first stage installed by downloading the malicious apps uploaded on Google Play Store only acts as a dropper. Following are some examples of the decoys used by these droppers: The purpose of Exodus One seems to be to collect some basic identifying information about the device (namely the IMEI code and the phone number) and send it to the Command & Control server. This is usually done in order to validate the target of a new infection. This is further corroborated by some older and unobfuscated samples from 2016, whose primary classes are named CheckValidTarget . During our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins. This suggests that the operators of the Command & Control are not enforcing a validation of the targets. Additionally, during a period of several days, our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators .

The “FlashVars” property contains a long string with 4 URLs which are passed to the downloaded Flash application. The Flash application is an obfuscated downloader which creates a random 512-bit RSA key pair in memory of the process. While the private key remains only in memory, the public keys’ modulus n is sent to the attacker’s server. On the server side, the modulus is used together with the hardcoded exponent e 0x10001 to encrypt the 128-bit AES key which was used previously to encrypt the exploit and shellcode payload. The encrypted exploit or payload is sent back to the downloader which uses the in-memory private key to decrypt the AES key and the exploit or payload. As the modulus is sent to the server of the",0

We believe this sample was used in the attack on Altran. We do not know how the ransomware infected Altran’s networks or propagated once there. Propagation Currently LockerGoga does not support any worm-like capabilities that would allow it to self-propagate by infecting additional hosts on a target network. We have observed LockerGoga moving around a network via the server message block (SMB) protocol, which indicates the actors simply manually copy files from computer to computer. LockerGoga Characteristics This sample requires administrative privileges in order to successfully execute, though the specific mechanism for initial code execution is unknown. Once it executes it seeks to encrypt files on the infected computer and any attached hard drives.

For example, in April 2017, FireEye blogged about FIN7’s spear phishing emails that leveraged hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim. This was a direct departure from their established use of weaponized Office macros and highlighted the group’s adaptive nature to evade detection. FireEye also previously reported on FIN7’s use of the CARBANAK backdoor as a post-exploitation tool to cement their foothold in a network and maintain access to victim environments. CARBANAK is well known for its use in highly profitable and sophisticated attacks dating back to 2013, with usage attributable to FIN7 beginning in late 2015, although how interconnected the campaigns employing the malware over this five-year span are is unclear. FIN7’s use of CARBANAK is particularly notable due to their use of creative persistence mechanisms to launch the backdoor. The group leveraged an application shim database that injected a malicious in-memory patch into the Services Control Manager (""services.exe"") process , and then spawned a CARBANAK backdoor process. FIN7 also used this tactic to install a payment card harvesting utility. Another notable characteristic of FIN7 has been their heavy use of digital certificates . Unsurprisingly, malicious threat actors have sought to exploit the legitimacy afforded by these certificates. By digitally signing their phishing documents, backdoors and later stage tools, FIN7 was able to bypass many security controls that may limit execution of macros from Office documents and restrict execution of unsigned binaries on trusted systems.

Just as we saw previously, the email is written in Italian and states that the original message is included as an attachment. You can see the original email titled ""postacert.eml"" attached. The following pops up once the email is opened: This is where the distribution process started to shift. There are not any attachments in the email, but instead, there is a hyperlink that makes a connection to hxxp:\\tribunaledinapoli[.]recsinc[.]com/documento.zip with a parameter that is referenced in the email. For example, above the full URL was hxxp:\\tribunaledinapoli[.]recsinc[.]com/documento.zip?214299. Note that the number 214299 is the number referenced in the email itself.

Following a partner tip identifying IP addresses hosting entertainment industry spoofed domains hosting credential harvesting sites, we identified over 50 domains and 320 subdomains most likely associated with a single actor or group. These domains were registered between 2017 – 2019 and suggest a widespread, ongoing campaign as of early March of this year, but we have yet to identify the actor’s motivations, whether they are targeting the spoofed organizations, and what they intend to use stolen credentials for. In this case, we were able to build out an understanding of this actor’s infrastructure using a variety of capabilities from DomainTools, Farsight DNSDB, and Censys. Notably, this actor had a penchant to reuse SSL certificate common names and domain name strings across their other domains’ subdomains. Exploiting these crossovers helped us identify connections where WHOIS or hosting co-location research failed.

Thus, this blogpost aims to help defenders counter these PowerShell scripts. We will also present various payloads, including an RPC-based backdoor and a backdoor leveraging OneDrive as its Command and Control (C&C) server. PowerShell Loader The PowerShell loader has three main steps: persistence, decryption and loading into memory of the embedded executable or library. Persistence The PowerShell scripts are not simple droppers; they persist on the system as they regularly load into memory only the embedded executables. We have seen Turla operators use two persistence methods: A Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscription Alteration of the PowerShell profile ( profile.ps1 file). Windows Management Instrumentation In the first case, attackers create two WMI event filters and two WMI event consumers . The consumers are simply command lines launching base64-encoded PowerShell commands that load a large PowerShell script stored in the Windows registry. Figure 1 shows how the persistence is established.

The actors' preference for open-source solutions appears to be part of a broader trend in which adversaries are increasingly using publicly available solutions, possibly to improve operational security. These obfuscation techniques will require network defenders to modify their posture and procedures to detect this threat. This report outlines the various anti-detection techniques used throughout the Frankenstein campaign. Some of these techniques included checking to see if any analysis tools, such as Process Explorer, were running in the background and determining whether the sample was inside of a virtual machine. The threat actors also took additional steps to only respond to GET requests that contained predefined fields, such as a non-existent user-agent string, a session cookie, and a particular directory on the domain. The threat actors also used different types of encryption in order to protect data in transit.

Some samples of later payload variants also have been given the generic and brittle names of TROJ_RESETTER.BB and TROJ_FRAUDROP.EX . Originally, the payloads delivered to targets by this threat group consisted of a password protected Self-extracting Zip-archive (.SFX) file which, when extracted, wrote a batch script to disk and installed a legitimate remote administration tool called tool Remote Manipulator System (Figure 1) which they would abuse for malicious purposes. Figure 1 Remote Manipulator System Interface One such self-extracting archive (ca87eb1a21c6d4ffd782b225b178ba65463f73de6f4c736eb135be5864f556dc) was first observed around April of 2014. The password (reused by many of the password protected SFX payloads) it used to extract itself is “1234567890__”. The files included in this SFX file we observed include a batch file named “123.cmd” and another SFX named “setting.exe”. This second SFX contains a .MSI installer package which installs Remote Manipulator System and a batch script which handles the installation. Later payloads would write batch scripts to disk as well as wget binaries. The batch scripts would use the wget binaries to download and execute additional executables. The scripts would also use wget to send POST requests to command and control (C2) servers that would contain information about the compromised system. Some of these payloads included decoy documents that would open when the malware is executed. Three examples of this type of payload include: a6a44ee854c846f31d15b0ca2d6001fb0bdddc85f17e2e56abb2fa9373e8cfe7 b5199a302f053e5e9cb7e82cc1e502b5edbf04699c2839acb514592f2eeabb13 3ef3a06605b462ea31b821eb76b1ea0fdf664e17d010c1d5e57284632f339d4b We first observed these samples using wget in 2014.

Below is an example of an email associated with one of the campaigns targeting Germany. Figure 1: Example email (German) The email is fairly basic and includes an attached ZIP archive. The subject line ""Zahlungserinnerung"" roughly translates to ""Payment Reminder,"" which is a theme consistent with many of the malspam campaigns commonly observed in the wild. This particular campaign leveraged a Visual Basic for Applications (VBS) script that was responsible for initiating the JasperLoader infection process. We'll dive into the obfuscated script later. The campaigns targeting Germany were some of the only ones that were observed using VBS files to initiate the JasperLoader infection. Most of the attacks generally used DOCM files to download JasperLoader, and ultimately Gootkit. As previously mentioned, most of the JasperLoader campaign activity that has been observed over the past few months has been targeting Italy. As can be seen in the screenshot below, these emails are significantly different than those seen in the other campaigns. Rather than containing a malicious file attachment, these emails purport that they are notifications associated with the receipt of a ""certified email"" and contain an attached EML file. The threat actors distributing JasperLoader are leveraging a legitimate certified email service called Posta Elettronica Certificata ( PEC) to distribute these emails. This is a certified email service related to legislation recently passed in Italy involving new requirements associated with electronic invoicing that took effect at the beginning of 2019. This new legislation requires Italian businesses to use electronic invoicing to deliver invoices for both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions. Attackers have recognized that this is an attractive way to leverage an already trusted email service to maximize the likelihood that they can convince potential victims to open their malicious emails. Figure 2: Example ""Certified"" email One of the requirements associated with this new legislation is that all electronic invoicing emails must be signed and sent using a new platform called ""Sistema di Interscambio (SDI)."" Additionally, invoices should be sent using a specific XML-based format for consumption and that format should be verified and its validity confirmed before being transmitted to the recipient of the invoice.

Attackers’ toolset analysis During our research on MuddyWater campaigns, we were able to identify a number of tools and scripts used by this actor, providing a good understanding of this actor’s abilities. Most of the tools used are custom developed, while others are based on more generic and publicly available ones. The list includes: Nihay – C# Download-and-Execute tool LisfonService – C# RAT Client.py – Python RAT Client-win.py – SSH Python script Rc.py/Rc.exe – Basic Python RAT VBScript and VBA files Third-party scripts (Muddy, Losi Boomber, Slaver reverse tunnel…) Second stage PowerShell scripts Most of these tools are scripts written in Python or PowerShell. We noticed that MuddyWater compiles various offensive Python scripts into executables for portability, using Py2Exe and PyInstaller for this task. This includes Python scripts such as “CrackMapExec”, “shootback” and “Lazagne”. We have also noticed the use of “PS2EXE” to convert PowerShell scripts into executables, with the original PowerShell code embedded as a Base64-encoded string. In other cases, we have noticed a preference for using PowerShell Reflective DLL injection to deploy Metasploit Stageless Meterpreters. They use both 32-Bit and 64-Bit versions.

The initial claim included several screenshots of systems potentially in use by OilRig operators for attacks, a script that appeared to be used for DNS hijacking, and a password protected archive with the filename Glimpse.rar purporting to contain the command and control server panel for an OilRig backdoor. Soon after, a Twitter account with the user handle @dookhtegan appeared claiming they also had access to data dumps involving internal tools and data used by the OilRig group, as seen in Figure 1 . This account used an image from 2004 of a high-profile Iranian asylum seeker named Mehdy Kavousi who famously sewed his eyes and mouth shut to signify that rejecting his asylum claim and sending him back to Iran would be akin to putting him to death. It is unknown why this specific image was chosen, other than perhaps as a symbol of protest. Since the initial account creation, a stylized version of the original has been substituted as the profile image, making it far more difficult to understand who the original individual was. Figure 1. Tweets by @dookhtegan providing files associated with the OilRig leak This account continued a series of tweets voicing protest against the OilRig group and attributing its operations with a specific nation state and organization. Unit 42 is unable to validate this level of attribution, but a 2018 report from the United States National Counterintelligence and Security Center stated the OilRig group originates from an Iranian nexus. The account continued to post tweets with direct links to operational data dumps hosted on an anonymous file sharing service. The files posted included the previously password protected archive Glimpse.rar , as well as new archives containing hundreds of harvested credentials from compromised organizations along with details on exposed login prompts. There were also links to webshells previously and possibly currently deployed, the webshell source codes, as well as another backdoor and its server component. This account was suspended in short order, but immediately after the suspension, an alternate account with the username @dookhtegan1 with the same stylized profile image appeared and is still currently active.

The ransomware needs be executed from a privileged account. LockerGoga works in a master/slave configuration. The malware begins its infection on an endpoint by installing a copy of itself on the %TEMP% folder. After being copied, it will start a new process with the -m parameter. The master process runs with the -m parameter and is responsible for creating the list of files to encrypt and spawning the slaves. The slave processes will be executed with a different set of parameters as shown below. Each slave process will encrypt only a small number of files, to avoid heuristic detections available in endpoint security products. The list of files to encrypt is taken from the master process via IPC, an interface used to share data between applications in Microsoft Windows. The communication is done through IPC using a mapped section named SM-<name of binary>. Here is the IPC technique used by LockerGoga: The master process (run as <LockerGogaBinary> -m) creates a named section on the system for IPC. The section is named “SM-tgytutrc”.

Analysis The attribution of forensic artifacts to specific threat actors, at whatever level, is an evolving, dynamic process - not a static one. Yet, much of the public research that originally defined the “known APT groups” appears to be frozen in time. When private security companies began declaring APT groups and minting an alphabet soup of threat actors bearing nicknames with numbers, animals, elements, demons and gods, they sketched profiles of nation states and their proxies by invoking the intelligence-version of a signature. Pictures emerged that reflected a particular group’s choice of tactics, techniques and attack procedures – the so-called TTPs that shape the way we tend to think about Iranian, Chinese, Russian and North Korean threats. This alphabet soup of nicknames engendered consequences not just for risk management at the enterprise level, but for national security policy as well. Many of these profiles were sketched nearly a decade ago; however, attribution is as much a function of a given window of technical evidence as it is a function of a given window of time. In the case of the forensic artifacts Area 1 associated with China’s SSF, evidence of shared or overlapping tools by Chinese groups once thought to operate separately or to employ separate targeting suggests one of several potential developments: It could indicate that Chinese government groups are expanding their reach beyond traditional boundaries or have been given different tasking/targeting It could indicate the",1

Using concepts from document clustering and topic modeling literature, this engine provides a framework to calculate and discover similarities between groups of activities, and then develop investigative leads for follow-on analysis. Our engine identified similarities between a series of intrusions within the engineering industry. The near real-time results led to an in-depth comparative analysis.

This is just a concatenation of two strings : Hardware Profile ID GetCurrentHwProfileA is used to retrieve the current hardware profile of the computer with the value of szHwProfileGuid . If it fails, it will return ""Unknown"" here. The Machine GUID With the help of RegOpenKeyExA , the value of the registry key is fetched: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid This is the UUID created by Windows during the installation of the operating system. When it's done, the mutex is created, just like this : String setup When Vidar is entering in the main function, it needs to store some required strings to be able to work properly for some further steps. All the RVA address of each string are stored in the .data section. The malware will go there to access to the requested string. This is a trick to slow down the static analysis of the malware, but this is really easy to surpass 🙂 C2 Domain & Profile ID When the malware is generated by the builder on the customer area. A unique ID is hardcoded into it. When Vidar will request this value on the malicious domain, it will retrieve the corresponding profile that the threat actor wants to grab/steal into the victim machine. So on this case, this the profile ID is ""178"". If there is no config on the malware, the profile ID ""1"" is hardcoded into it. The C2 domain is a simple XORed string, the key is directly put into the XOR function to decrypt the data. And decrypted it's in fact ""newagenias.com"" Configs are possible to be extracted easily with the script izanami.py on my GitHub repository.

Further analysis uncovered a broader phishing campaign targeting four different Kingdom of Saudi Arabia government agencies and a single Saudi-based financial institution. The campaign dates back to least late-November 2016 in which over 90 confirmed phishing hostnames (46 unique domains) were created to target at least five KSA entities. Given the attackers targeting affinity for the Saudi Ministry of Interior’s Absher portal, which represents close to 60 percent of the KSA-related phishing sites, we have named the campaign “Bad Tidings” after the English language translation “Good Tidings” of the Arabic language word “Absher”. Prior to release of this blog post, Anomali and STC have been coordinated with the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) and Saudi CERT to address this security concern. We also submitted the phishing sites to Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Defender Security Intelligence as an additional security measure to block the fraudulent websites. Bad Tidings Campaign Overview The Bad Tidings Campaign is an ongoing phishing campaign that began on or about November 21, 2016 and known for targeting four Kingdom of Saudi Arabia government agencies with a single occurrence against a Saudi-based financial institution. Since late-November 2016, our researchers have observed 95 unique phishing hostnames created either using misspelled, alternative top level domains (TLDs) other than the legitimate gov.sa domains, or punycode-based sites. To date, the attacker(s) have targeted the following KSA entities: First Seen Last Seen KSA Entity Number of Observed Phishing Sites 12/17/2017 3/16/2019 Ministry of Interior (Absher) 54 (56.84%) 8/16/2017 3/17/2019 Saudi Government 18 (18.95%) 1/4/2018 3/18/2019 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 14 (14.74%) 8/16/2017 3/16/2019 Ministry of Labor and Social Development 7 (7.37%) 2/17/2019 2/19/2019 Saudi British Bank 2 (2.11%) Characteristics of Bad Tidings",1

The word “비번” in the body of the email is a slang word is used mainly by South Koreans, so these hackers are proficient in South Korean. The zip attachment consists of two normal document files and a piece of executable malware disguised using a Hangul Word Processor (HWP) document icon with a lot of spaces in the filename so that the “.exe” extension is not visible to the user, thereby inducing file execution. When the malware is executed as an SFX (self-extracting archive) file type, it decompresses one normal Hangul Word Processor (HWP) document, “2.wsf” and “3.wsf”. What is unique about this is that it uses two different RATs. The first RAT is a DLL downloaded via “2.wsf” and the second RAT is the script-based “3.wsf” file. Even if one of them are detected, the other one gets used. A. DLL-based RAT (downloaded by ‘2.wsf’) The purpose of the “2.wsf” script is to download and run the BASE64 encoded “Freedom.dll” malware.

The infrastructure used by the combination of malware families is pretty vast, with plenty of overlaps, however in this blog we focus only on some of the core ties captured in the green rectangle, as shown in Figure 2 below. Figure 2 Maltego chart showing overlaps between Farseer and related threats Figure 2 shows a high-level representation of file hashes, IP addresses, and domain names used by some of the various malware families already mentioned, together with their overlaps. Farseer has the largest number of samples in Figure 2 but that’s skewed given the focus of this blog. The green rectangle shows some of the core overlaps between the aforementioned families, which we will discuss in more detail now. The most recent (at the point of publishing) Farseer sample (SHA256: 271E29FE… detailed in Table 2 below) introduced a new C2 domain – tcpdo[.]net – into the Farseer set, as shown in Figure 3 below. Figure 3 Maltego diagram showing tcpdo [.]net and other Farseer / PoisonIvy overlaps . Figure 3 shows how this new (to Farseer) domain relates both directly to said Farseer sample and indirectly, through third-level domains and IP addresses, to other Farseer samples; a handful of Poison Ivy samples have also used this domain as their C2, mostly before this Farseer sample – as early as mid-2015 – but also more recently, one month after, on December 17 th , 2018 indicating it’s a domain in fairly active use. Third-level domains of tcpdo[.]net, together with all other indicators are listed at the end of this blog. The overlaps between Farseer and Poison Ivy don’t end with tcpdo[.]net. Much",1
1363,Long_Train,"In Cybercrime February 28, 2019 By Yonathan Klijnsma Facebook Twitter Linkedin E-mail In November of 2018, we published the cornerstone report "" Inside Magecart ,"" in which we disclosed the existence of seven distinct Magecart groups and described in detail their operations and the different ways they skim payment information. Since then, we’ve detailed even more groups, such as Group 11 and Group 12 . After our researchers surface more Magecart instances in RiskIQ’s automated detection, attribution is usually the final step in our analysis. However, we also spend a lot of time keeping up with each group and how it evolves. In this article, we’ll get back to a group we covered in the “Inside Magecart” report: Magecart Group 4.

Other modules associated with DanaBot include remote desktop through VNC, information stealing, and keylogging. While it appears that this recent attack may be looking to establish a foothold in the network, the reasons behind this are currently unknown. Following the Attack Chain The attack begins with a seemingly innocuous email: As can be seen, this email was sent in early February through a legitimate free email service available to everyone. In addition, the sender has not been registered as a spam-related email address, which adds to the analysis that this is a specifically targeted attack. The link in the email (hxxp://users.xxxx.com.au/soniamatas/9302030002_993.zip?33505757) also points to an ISP that offers file hosting services. Based on",0

However, this combination of RADMIN and MIMIKATZ becomes a concern for data exfiltration of enterprise assets and information because of the randomly named and seemingly-valid Windows functions that may go undetected. Also, we found it interesting that the sample itself does not download the coinminer. Instead, the miner malware payload is remotely downloaded and dropped through the command sent via RADMIN to the target machine. While using outdated software, the modular",0

In addition to the previously mentioned facts, we quickly noticed that the malware was connecting to the Slack platform, a collaborative messaging system that lets users create and use their own workspaces through the use of channels, similar to the IRC chatting system. We found this quite interesting, since we haven’t observed any malware to date that communicates using Slack– although we’ve previously discussed how cybercriminals could possibly abuse chat platforms as part of their attack. Our technical investigation and analysis of the attacker’s tools, techniques, and procedures (TTP) lead us to think that this threat is actually a stealthy targeted attack run by capable actors, and not a typical cybercriminal scheme. Note that as soon as this malware was discovered, we informed the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, which acts",0
