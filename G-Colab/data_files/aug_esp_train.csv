663,Train,"At the beginning of October 2017, we discovered new Android spyware with several features previously unseen in the wild. In the course of further research, we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process. We believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago – at the end of 2014. Since then, the implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals.",0
1735,Train,"Key individuals, who are believed to be part of a China-based attack group, have been stealing years of valuable government and corporate information from defense and high technology organizations in the US since 2013 and political and government- associate entities in China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines since 2010.

This shift in targets is highly notable for the high cyber espionage operation we dubbed as “Operation Iron Tiger.” We believe that the threat actors have simply moved up in the food chain and were assigned new, active -level targets to spy on–all as part of a bigger espionage campaign.

US defense contractors were only fairly recent targets based on the operation’s history, which we traced to spear-phishing in 2010. “Foreign policy,” “future of the US Army Officer Corps,” and “economic development” are only a few of the keywords that threat actors have been using in spear-phishing attacks against director and project managers of technology-inclined US government contractors.",1

Patchwork’s moniker is from its notoriety for rehashing off-the-rack tools and malware for its own campaigns. The attack vectors they use may not be groundbreaking—what with other groups exploit zero-days or adjusting their tactics—but the group’s repertoire of infection vectors and payloads makes them a credible threat.

We trailed Patchwork’s activities over the course of its campaigns in 2017. The diversity of their methods is own —from the social engineering hooks, attack chains, and backdoors they deployed. They’ve also joined the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) and Windows Script Component (SCT) abuse bandwagons and started exploiting recently reported vulnerabilities. These imply they’re at least keeping an eye on other threats and security flaws that they can repurpose for their notable ends. Also of note are its attem",1

From “Ploutus”, “Greendispenser”, “Prilex”, traditional criminals and Latin American cybercriminals have been working closely and effectively to steal large sums of money directly from ATMs with quite an elevated rate of success. In order to do it, they have developed a number of tools and techniques that are unique to this region, eventually importing malware from Eastern European cybercriminals and then improving the code to create their own domestic solutions, which they later deploy on a larger scale.",0

Since we began tracking LCG Kit, we have observed it using the Microsoft Equation Editor CVE-2017-11882 [1] exploit in various forms. More recently, its authors have integrated a VB Script exploit, CVE-2018-8174 [2], which has been used used in limited email campaigns. Finally, at the end of November, LCG Kit added the ability to use Microsoft Word macros instead of exploits to load the shellcode responsible for installing malware payloads.

Due to the widespread appearance of malicious attachments created with LCG Kit in a number of email campaigns,, we presume that it may be for sale on underground forums. LCG Kit appears to be popular with small crimeware groups for spreading Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and stealers including Loki Bot, FormBook, Agent Tesla, Remcos, AZORult, Revcode RAT, Quasar RAT and more in campaigns that typically involve thousands of malicious email messages.",0

Cobalt Strike has been their primary toolset for command and control within the victim networks, while BeEF has been used to assist in the initial infection process.

On the network traffic analysis end, post compromise activity results in some interesting but not unexpected activity. First, Winnti uses Cobalt Strike to collect credentials and move laterally.

It creates a highly profitable business model that allows attackers to directly monetize their nefarious activities. However, there are a couple of limitations with the use of ransomware. First is the fact that only a small percentage of infected users will actually pay the ransom demanded by the attacker. Second, as systems and technology get better at detecting and blocking ransomware attacks the pool of possible victims is change . Potential victims in many countries lack the financial capabilities to pay $300-$500 to retrieve their data. Possibly related to these aforementioned limitations, we have begun to see a steady shift in the payloads that are being delivered.

Second, as systems and technology get better at detecting and blocking ransomware attacks the pool of possible victims is changing. Potential victims in many countries lack the financial capabilities to pay $300-$500 to retrieve their data.

The construction of the webshell was interesting by itself, as it was actually two separate webshells: an initial webshell that was responsible for saving and loading the second fully functional webshell. It is this second webshell that enabled the threat actor to run a variety of commands on the compromised server. Due to these two layers, we use the name TwoFace to track this webshell.",0

While we have no hard evidence that the Catelites actor is linked to Cron, it is likely that Cron members have used the Catalites malware in their campaigns based on what we’ve seen so far. In the past few months, we have seen one or two fake apps per week attacking Android devices to make unsuspecting victims download the malware. Once downloaded, the criminals use very sophisticated social engineering tricks to get credit card information and possibly the ability to get into the victim’s bank account.",0

Underminer delivers a bootkit that infects the system’s boot sectors as well as a cryptocurrency-mining malware named Hidden Mellifera. Underminer transfers malware via an encrypted transmission control protocol (TCP) tunnel and packages malicious files with a customized format similar to ROM file system format (romfs). These make the exploit kits and its payload challenging to analyze.,0

At this time, we don&#39;t know how the attacker managed to enroll the targeted devices. Enrollment could be done through physical access to the devices, or most likely by using social engineering to entice a user to register. In social engineering attacks the victim is tricked into clicking accept or giving the attacker physical access to a device. This campaign is of note since the malware goes to great lengths to replace specific mobile apps for data interception. Talos has worked closely with Apple on countering this threat. Apple had already actioned 3 certificates associated with this actor when Talos reached out, and quickly moved to action the two others once Talos tied them to the threat.",1

We previously highlighted the dangers of installing apps that enable IAPs using SMS messages, as these apps typically have access to all SMS messages sent to the phone.
While not all SMS-based IAP applications steal user data, we recently identified that the Chinese Taomike SDK has begun capturing copies of all messages received by the phone and sending them to a Taomike controlled server.
