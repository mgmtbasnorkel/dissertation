The actors weaponized the delivery document to install a variant of the ‘9002’ Trojan called ‘3102’ that heavily relies on plugins to provide functionality needed by the actors to carry out on their objectives. The 3102 payload used in this attack also appears to be related to the Evilgrab payload delivered in the watering hole attack hosted on the President of Myanmar’s website in May 2015. Additionally, we uncovered ties between the C2 infrastructure and individuals in China active in online hacking forums that claim to work in Trojan development.

Cisco customers who have Cisco AMP configured to submit samples, allowed us to identify attempted attacks on their end users. We used that as an initial starting point for our investigations. A Nullsoft Installer based executable was used in an attempt to compromise the victim hosts. The adversaries were using the Nullsoft Installer to execute a malicious DLL which starts the unpacking process of the ransomware payload. This is a similar behavior, as seen in the previous version, which was distributed two weeks before this campaign. The attackers were also using the Nullsoft Installer to execute a malicious unpacking DLL. In that case it was called Cavalry.dll (and other names). Both Cavalry.dll and Incognito.dll are totally different from an obfuscation point of view, nevertheless they both eventually infect the local machine with Crypt0l0cker. It is worth to note that besides using TLS encrypted back channels for exfiltrating user and other information to servers placed in the internet, the sample uses Tor as a backup for these connections. In other ransomware campaigns we have often seen that only the payment process was protected by Tor, not the whole infection chain. Crypt0l0cker appears to be using the Tor servers as fallbacks, if the SSL servers are not reachable. More and more malware is leveraging Tor to hide their tracks. Obviously this makes it harder to detect these campaigns in the network traffic (Tor traffic aside). It also takes more time to identify the malware infrastructure to finally take them down.

However, the group behind MuddyWater has been known to target other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the US. We recently noticed a large amount of spear phishing documents that appear to be targeting government bodies, military entities, telcos and educational institutions in Jordan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Pakistan, in addition to the continuous targeting of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, other victims were also detected in Mali, Austria, Russia, Iran and Bahrain.. These new documents have appeared throughout 2018 and escalated from May onwards. The attacks are still ongoing. The new spear-phishing docs used by MuddyWater rely on social engineering to persuade users to enable macros. The attackers rely on a range of compromised hosts to deliver their attacks.

Many owners of popular game servers also raise money from players by selling various privileges such as protection against bans, access to weapons, etc. Some server owners advertise themselves independently, while others purchase server promotion services from contractors.

Talos has recently identified a marked increase in the quantity of malware distribution activity associated with Brushaloader, as well as the implementation of various techniques and evasive functionality that has resulted in significantly lower detection rates, as well as sandbox evasion. The advanced command-line auditing and reporting available within ThreatGrid make analyzing threats such as Brushaloader much more efficient. Threats such as Brushaloader demonstrate the importance of ensuring that PowerShell logging is enabled and configured on endpoints in most corporate environments. History of Brushaloader The first Brushaloader campaign that caught our attention was back in August 2018. It was initially notable because it was only using Polish language emails targeting Polish victims. Although it is common to see threats target users in multiple languages, attackers typically don't target a single European country. Below is a sample of one of the emails from that initial campaign and shows the characteristics that we would come to expect from Brushaloader: a RAR attachment containing a Visual Basic script that results in a Brushaloader infection ending in the eventual download and execution of Danabot. There is one other characteristic of this email that will remain a thread throughout all Brushaloader campaigns: ""Faktura,"" or the Polish word for invoices. There will be a few variations of this over the next several months, but regardless of language, invoices and billing will always play a vital role in these spam campaigns. As far as the attachment itself, it typically consists of a RAR file with a filename that contains the word ""faktura."" The RAR files typically contain a VBScript that reaches out for additional payloads. The script itself already had some interesting techniques associated with sandbox or network simulation evasion, which we will discuss later in the blog. This script wasn't heavily obfuscated, and efficiently established command and control (C2) communication with a hard-coded IP address via HTTP using wscript. The specific URL being queried in this particular campaign was: http://162[.]251[.]166[.]72/about.php?faxid=446708802&opt=.

Context Following OceanLotus’ activities is taking a tour in the world of deception. This group is known to lure victims by forging appealing documents to entice potential victims into executing the group’s backdoor, and keeps coming up with new ideas to diversify its toolset. The techniques employed for the decoys range from files with so-called double extensions, self-extracting archives and macro-enabled documents, to reusing known exploits. On top of that, they are very active and relentlessly continue to raid their favourite victims, South East Asian countries.

There's also a variant of the infamous AZORult information-stealing malware, a variant of Remcos remote access tool and, finally, the DarkVNC backdoor trojan. What's new? Embedding an executable downloader in an ISO image file is a relatively new method of delivery for AZORult. It's also unusual to see attackers using multiple methods to make money. How did it work? The infection chain starts with a ZIP file, which contains an ISO disk image file. When the user opens the ISO file, a disk image containing an executable loader is mounted. When the loader is launched, it deobfuscates malicious code which downloads the first obfuscated PowerShell loader stage that kickstarts the overall infection, disables security tools and Windows update service and downloads and launches the payloads. So what? Defenders need to be constantly vigilant and monitor the behavior of systems within their network. Attackers are like water — they will attempt to find the smallest crack to achieve their goals. While organizations need to be focused on protecting their most valuable assets, they should not ignore threats that are not particularly targeted toward their infrastructure. Technical case overview Introduction The initial trigger for this investigation was a telemetry entry that showed a PowerShell process launching a download and executing a PowerShell loader. After the drill-down, the telemetry shows that the PowerShell downloading code was launched by an executable dropper included in an ISO image that's mounted within the operating system by the user.

Private email addresses are more likely to be hosted on free email services with lax security and spam filtering. They’re also usually used as verification for social media and e-commerce websites, as well as backups for Gmail and business accounts. Gmail accounts are particularly interesting; attackers that gain access to these accounts can also access the victim’s Google Drive, and, under certain circumstances, potentially compromise the Android device linked to the account. These free email accounts could thus serve as better starting points for attackers to reconnoiter and gather intelligence on their targets compared to business emails, which are typically more secure.

Compared to when C&C information is embedded within the malware, where it’s preset and can thus be easily blocked, this tactic lets Blackgear’s operators to quickly change C&C servers as needed.

In this version of Ursnif I have also encountered an internal peer-to-peer communication which could possibly add the ability for the sample to communicate with other Ursnif peers over the same network. We will discuss the peer-to-peer part in a future blog post. It All Begins With An Executable When the Ursnif executable is first loaded, it will unpack the real payload. The real payload is packed by the attackers, because it helps keeping it undetected by security solutions which are based on a file signature. After the real payload is unpacked, it will run in a hollowed process, and even at that stage of unpacking, the . BSS section is still obfuscated and will be de-xored on runtime before the malware will continue with the execution. The bss section before and after dexoring it Afterward, there is a simple check the malware authors left behind. If the file C:\321.txt exists, the checks for a virtualized environment are ignored. This was most probably developed in order to allow the attackers to test their tool on their own virtualized machines. Even though it is quite funny that the attackers left this piece of code in a production compilation, it might show how careless they are. Basically, if anyone else would like to test Ursnif on a virtual machine, they can just create a file with that name at that location and the malware will work properly with no need to change the virtual machine's configurations. Next, the malware will make sure that all of the users on the machine are infected, by enumerating the registry root key HKU and for each user key, it will put an appropriate startup value, as well as the payload on each AppData folder of each user. Registry Keys used: • HKU\<SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ • HKU\<SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders\ AppData ○ (Value equals the folder to be used for the malware, for example: C:\Users\Administrator\Appdata\Roaming\"") After this procedure, we move on to the injection method.

We believe this malicious software has been developed by the Animal Farm espionage group, who also created the infamous Casper , Bunny and Babar malware. Dino contains interesting technical features, and also a few hints that the developers are French speaking. Animal Farm is the security industry’s name for a group of attackers first described by Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) in a set of slides leaked by Edward Snowden in March 2014. In those slides CSE assess with “moderate certainty” that this group is a French intelligence agency.

Of course, to maintain such a large botnet, a reliable command and control (C&C) infrastructure is required. For malware with a small outreach, or if infected computers are not part of a single botnet, virtual private servers (VPS) are most often used. VPS hosting services can be purchased from legitimate companies. Many VPS hosting providers don’t require identity verification, and the services can be paid for anonymously. However, in the case of the Phorpiex botnet, a public VPS is not suitable. First of all, the C&C server for such a botnet would immediately attract attention with a large amount of malicious traffic: several million requests per day from more than 100,000 unique IP addresses are sent to the Phorpiex C&C servers. By our assessment, the monthly volume of the botnet’s C&C traffic may exceed 70 TB. Therefore, Phorpiex doesn’t use public VPS hosting services. Instead, it uses dedicated IP subnets registered to figureheads. Botnet Architecture Initially, the Phorpiex has been known as a botnet operated using IRC protocol (also known as Trik).

These are the IoT botnets associated with unprecedented Distributed Denial of Service attacks in November 2016 and since. These variants are notable for two reasons: The new Mirai version targets the same Apache Struts vulnerability associated with the Equifax data breach in 2017. The new Gafgyt version targets a newly disclosed vulnerability affecting older, unsupported versions of SonicWall’s Global Management System (GMS). These developments suggest these IOT botnets are increasingly targeting enterprise devices with outdated versions. All organizations should ensure they keep not only their systems up-to-date and patched, but also their IoT devices.

Notably, the payload delivered in these campaigns leveraged a packer previously affiliated with a commonly-tracked threat actor, an overlap that we will explore later. This blog post will review the theme of these campaigns and their targets, the adversary’s unique tradecraft, the MINEBRIDGE C++ backdoor, some potential attribution overlaps, and importantly — the threat actor’s love of rap music. Targeting and Lure Detail While we first identified MINEBRIDGE samples in December, we observed our first phishing campaigns relating to this activity in early January 2020. Email addresses used to send phishing messages were associated with domains that appear to have been registered specifically for this purpose within a few weeks of the activity — and were thematically consistent with the content of the phishing messages. Additionally, the actor(s) responsible are likely using a self-hosted email marketing solution called Acelle . Acelle adds extended email headers to messages sent via the platform in the format of X-Acelle-<variable>. The messages observed across campaigns using these TTPs have included a “Customer-Id” value matching “X-Acelle-Customer-Id: 5df38b8fd5b58”. While that field remained consistent across all observed campaigns, individual campaigns also shared overlapping “X-Acelle-Sending-Server_Id” and “X-Acelle-Campaign-Id” values. All of the messages also included a “List-Unsubscribe” header offering a link hosted at 45.153.184.84 suggesting that it is the server hosting the Acelle instance used across these campaigns.
