A typical Lurk infection uses browser exploits to deliver non-persistent payloads to potential victims, probing their targets before deploying additional malware. The infection chain had multiple stages, and was accomplished using bodiless/fileless exploit payloads executed in-memory without additional persistence mechanisms. No traces were left on affected systems apart from files from the exploit process if the target machine wasn’t interesting to the Lurk operators.

Given what we&#39;ve seen previously with Vawtrak, simply switching to HTTPS is not a major update in terms of development -- but it does show that the threat actors are interested in protecting their C2 communications.

Here are some significant updates to Vawtrak:

- The malware now includes a DGA. Interestingly, it utilizes a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) used in Vawtrak&#39;s loader.
- The DGA hosted site further serves up a list of domains that are cycled through for C2. In this respect, Vawtrak now has a 2-tier C2 discovery infrastructure.

RtPOS is unique in comparison to other fully featured POS malware like Project Hook and TreasureHunter, in that it has no native exfiltration capability. While other POS malware families are perfectly capable of sending captured Track1 and Track2 data to a C2 server, RtPOS merely saves the data locally. As this activity is similar to some POS utilities, this is likely intended to reduce the network activity footprint of RtPOS and ensure the malware remains undetected for longer, thus earning the controllers a healthier profit.

1996,Train,"On December 20, 2018 the US Department of Justice indicted two Chinese nationals on charges of computer hacking, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. The two are alleged members of a hacking group known as menuPass (aka APT10/Stone Panda/Red Apollo/CVNX/Potassium) which according to the indictment, allegedly carried out the illegal activity at the behest of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. The charges in the indictment stem from a lengthy attack campaign called Operation Cloud Hopper that began in 2014 which largely targeted Managed Security Providers (MSPs) to not only steal MSP and clients’ intellectual property but also leverage the networks for further attacks. The US-Cert also published two advisories, TA17-117A and TA18-276B. The first details the activity and the second contained protection, detection, and remediation advice for MSPs and customers.",1,1,0

Further analysis of the threat actor’s infrastructure uncovered a broader phishing campaign targeting several email providers, financial institutions, and a payment card provider.

2001,Train,"The prodigious ascent of cryptocurrency-mining malware was not only brought about by its high profit potential, but also due to its ability to remain undetected within a system, especially when combined with various obfuscation routines. The concept of a stealthy, difficult-to-detect malware operating behind the scenes has proven to be an irresistible proposition for many threat actors, and they’re evidently adding even more techniques, as seen in a cryptocurrency miner (detected as Coinminer.Win32.MALXMR.TIAOODAM) we discovered that uses multiple obfuscation and packing as part of its routine.",0,0,0

Through investigations into infrastructure used by HenBox malware, Unit 42 has discovered another malware family built for the more frequently-targeted Microsoft Windows operating system they named ‘Farseer’. As with HenBox, Farseer also has infrastructure ties to other malware, such as Poison Ivy, Zupdax, and PKPLUG.
