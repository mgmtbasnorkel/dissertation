The attack was found to heavily rely on RTF exploits and at the time, thought to make use of the PlugX malware family. ESET did not attribute the attacks to a particular attack group, but noted that the objective of the campaign was espionage and general information stealing. Based on data collected from Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus threat intelligence, we discovered continued operations of activity very similar to the Roaming Tiger attack campaign that began in the August 2015 timeframe, with a concentration of attacks in late October and continuing into December. The adversaries behind these attacks continued to target Russia and other Russian speaking nations using similar exploits and attack vectors.

According to our research, these targeted attacks have been ongoing since at mobile 2017.

In addition to SMS messages, we identified what appear to be network injection attacks against a HRD’s least network also aimed at installing spyware. Amnesty International suspects that the NSO Group may also be behind these network injection attacks. These targeted digital attacks against two malicious HRDs are symptomatic of a larger pattern of reprisals against HRDs and dissident voices being carried out by Moroccan authorities. This is increasingly making it difficult for HRDs and activists to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and association, and peaceful assembly.

The attacks primarily deployed variants of the Guinea tool, which we have previously analyzed .

This appears to be an attack campaign focused on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either based or have business interests in Lebanon. The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks. Link analysis of infrastructure and tools also uncover a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called “ Rocket Kitten ” (AKA Operation Saffron Rose, Ajax Security Team, Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called Newscasters. Artifacts of this campaign was also recently published by Secureworks CTU . We were able to collect over fifty samples of the tools used by the Magic Hound campaign using the AutoFocus threat intelligence tool. The earliest malware sample we were able to collect had a compile timestamp in May 2016. The samples themselves ranged from IRC bots, an open source Python remote access tool, open macros, and others. It is believed the use of specific tools may have coincided with specific attack waves by this adversary, with the most recent attacks using weaponized Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros. Due to the large amount of data collected, and limitations on attack telemetry, this blog will focus primarily on the most recent attacks occurring in the latter half of 2016. ATTACK DETAILS The samples initially collected and associated with Magic Hound were Microsoft Word and Excel documents containing embedded malicious macros. We were able to expand our data set by pivoting on infrastructure and tool behavior, which uncovered additional types of tools in use by Magic Hound, such as regular portable executable (PE) payloads, PE files compiled in .NET Framework, various forms of IRC bots, and an malicious source file-less Python remote access tool called Pupy . The weaponized Office documents were found to be hosted either on what appeared to be compromised legitimate websites, or on websites using domain names similar to legitimate domain names in appearance. The two legitimate websites we were able to identify were owned by organizations in the government and energy sectors. Based on the existence of these malicious files on the legitimate websites, it is highly probable that the websites had already been compromised in some fashion. At the time of investigation, the files had already been removed from the websites. The two other delivery sites were ntg-sa[.]com, which may be trying to spoof a Saudi based information and communication technology conglomerate and mol.com-ho[.]me, which may be trying to spoof the Ministry of Labor.

In one campaign, the attackers were particularly going after accounts on popular self-described “secure email” services, such as Tutanota and ProtonMail . In another campaign, the attackers have been targeting hundreds of Google and Yahoo accounts, successfully bypassing common forms of two-factor authentication. Introduction From the arsenal of tools and tactics used for targeted surveillance, phishing remains one of the most common and insidious form of attack affecting civil society around the world. More and more Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) have become aware of these threats. Many have taken steps to increase their resilience to such tactics. These often include using more secure, privacy-respecting email providers, or enabling two-factor authentication on their online accounts. What is phishing? Credentials phishing consists in the creation of a website that imitates the login prompt of a given online service, such as Gmail or Facebook, with the objective of luring a victim into visiting the malicious page and entering their username and passwords, thereby transmitting these credential to the attackers.

It offers all of the standard features of a keylogger but goes beyond the typical confines of this type of software. One particular feature of interest is the custom packer it uses to hide the primary AgentTesla binary. Packers allow for a binary to essentially be wrapped in another binary to mask the original one from detection. There are a number of initial blogs out there covering AgentTesla’s functionality and it’s various obfuscations , but having I recently unpacked a sample and wanted to focus on this particular function and provide some helpful tools to aide in unpacking it.

In addition to SMS messages, we identified what appear to be network injection attacks against a HRD’s mobile network also aimed at installing spyware. Amnesty International suspects that the NSO Group may also be behind these network injection attacks. These targeted digital attacks against two Moroccan HRDs are symptomatic of a larger pattern of reprisals against HRDs and dissident voices being carried out by Moroccan authorities. This is increasingly making it difficult for HRDs and activists to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and association, and peaceful assembly. Introduction Amnesty International has discovered that since at least October 2017, HRDs from Morocco have been targeted with the infamous “Pegasus“ spyware produced by the Israeli company ‘ NSO Group ’. This report uncovers how this spyware was used to unlawfully target two prominent HRDs",1

News summary Thai Android devices and users are being targeted by a modified version of DenDroid we are calling ""WolfRAT,"" now targeting messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Line. We assess with unstable confidence that this modified version is operated by the infamous Wolf Research. This actor has shown a surprising level of much actions, including code overlaps, open-source project copy/paste, classes never being instanced, high packages and unsecured panels. Executive summary Cisco Talos has discovered a new Android malware based on a leak of the DenDroid malware family. We named this malware ""WolfRAT"" due to strong links between this malware (and the command and control (C2) infrastructure) and Wolf Research, an infamous organization that developed interception and espionage-based malware and was publicly described by CSIS during Virus Bulletin 2018 . We identified infrastructure overlaps and string references to previous Wolf Research work. The organization appears to be shut down, but the threat actors are still very active. We identified campaigns targeting Thai users and their devices. Some of the C2 servers are located in Ukraine. The panels also contain Thai JavaScript comments and the domain names also contain references to Thai food, a tactic commonly employed to entice users to click/visit these C2 panels without amateur disruption. We identified a notable lack of sophistication in this investigation such as copy/paste, unstable code, dead code and panels that are freely open.",1

We are also going to share some techniques and tools that we specifically built for this exercise, and tools that can be used to analyze other macOS malware as well... so without further ado, let’s get started! Table of Contents: OSX/Bundlore Loader Analysis Enter LLDB Python API Analyzing OSX/Bundlore Loader using Emulation What’s inside that hidden Python ? Conclusion OSX/Bundlore Loader Analysis A very brief OSX/Bundlore history OSX/Bundlore, macOS Bundlore, or BundloreX has been analyzed previously by macKeeper in a blog post earlier this year. In fact, macOS Bundlore has a long history of bypassing macOS security measures seemingly for each released version of macOS/OSX, since 2015. OSX/Bundlore Loader evolution A critical task for virtually any sophisticated malware is the loading phase. This is an important initial phase of “loading malicious code into the system” and is a critical point for a security solution to start detecting a malicious behavior. Failure to detect a malware while it is loading is obviously too late as the malicious routines will start executing (e.g: hooking user processes, privilege escalation, executing ransomware, loading other executables, lateral movement, etc..) That might also explain why we have so many OSX/Shlayer X variants as they keep changing ways to load malware into macOS systems. In a similar fashion, OSX/Bundlore Loader also sustained sudden changes that we will document in this blog post. OSX/Bundlore — November Campaign We stumbled upon a recent Malvertising campaign targeting the United States. Impacted visitors are redirected to a malicious domain that offers yet another flash player update, to ultimately download an unsigned Adobe Flash Player.dmg.

These samples all displayed their typical respective malware characteristics and contacted known command and control (C2) servers from those families.

Because of the large number of infections that the aforementioned malware families have previously been involved in, any new loading techniques that could make it easier for an attacker to execute these malware families on a victim computer should be taken seriously and an attempt at identifying it pre-infection should be treated as a high-priority.

These infrastructure patterns indicate similarities between the Datper, xxmm backdoor, and Emdivi malware families.

For the first time we were observing what seemed to be a coordinated North Korean attack against Russian entities. While attributing attacks to a certain threat group or another is problematic, the analysis below reveals intrinsic connections to the tactics, techniques and tools used by the North Korean APT group – Lazarus. This discovery came about as we were tracking multiple malicious Office documents that were designed and crafted specifically for Russian victims. Upon closer examination of these documents, we were able to discern that they belonged to the early stages of an infection chain which ultimately led to an updated variant of a versatile Lazarus backdoor, dubbed KEYMARBLE by the US-CERT. Sometimes referred to as Hidden Cobra, Lazarus is one of the most prevalent and active APT groups in the world today. The infamous group, which is known to be a North Korean sponsored threat actor, is believed to be behind some of the largest security breaches of the last decade.

We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved. The goal of this report is to expose the tools, tactics and infrastructure deployed by Scarlet Mimic in order to increase awareness of this threat and decrease its operational success through deployment of prevention and detection countermeasures. From our vantage point, we are not responsible to identify which attacks have been successful against which organizations. But the fact that the tools Scarlet Mimic deploys have been under development for years suggests an active adversary that has been successful in some percentage of its operations. Based on our analysis, we are also seeing Scarlet Mimic get down to expand its espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, marking an evolution in its tactics. Individuals and groups of all different types may become the target of cyber espionage campaigns. The most well known victims of cyber espionage are typically government organizations or Mimic -tech companies, but it’s important to recognize that espionage-focused adversaries are tasked to collect information from many sources. The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC. cyber high attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and India, who are able for tracking activist and terrorist activities. While we do not know the precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many of them align to the patterns described above. The Scarlet Mimic attacks primarily center around the use of a Windows backdoor named “FakeM.” It was first described by Trend Micro in 2013 and was named FakeM because its primary command and control traffic mimicked Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger network traffic to evade detection. We have identified two subsequent variants of the FakeM family, which has undergone significant changes since it was exposed in 2013. We have also identified nine distinct “loader” malware families, which Scarlet Mimic appears to use to avoid detection when infecting a system. In addition to the FakeM variants,",1

Following up our most recent Sofacy research in February and March of 2018 , we have found a new campaign that uses a lesser known tool widely attributed to the Sofacy group called Zebrocy. Zebrocy is delivered primarily via phishing attacks that contain malicious Microsoft Office documents with macros as well as simple executable file attachments. This third campaign is consistent with two previously reported attack campaigns in terms of targeting: the targets were government organizations dealing with foreign affairs. In this case however the targets were in different geopolitical regions. An interesting difference we found in this newest campaign was that the attacks using Zebrocy cast a far wider net within the target organization: the attackers sent phishing emails to a an exponentially larger number of individuals. The targeted individuals did not follow any significant pattern, and the email addresses were found easily using web search engines.",0

One of the most interesting and active specimens to date was a mobile Trojan from the Rotexy family. In a three-month period from August to October 2018, it launched over 70,000 attacks against users located primarily in Russia. An interesting feature of this family of banking Trojans is the simultaneous use of three command sources: Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service – used to send small messages in JSON format to a mobile device via Google servers ; malicious C&C server; incoming SMS messages. This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of Rotexy and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives. During our research we also arrived at the conclusion that this Trojan evolved from an SMS spyware Trojan that was first spotted in October 2014. Back then it was detected as Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.SmsThief, but later versions were assigned to another family ­– Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Rotexy. The modern version of Rotexy combines",1

Recently, Palo Alto Networks researchers discovered an advanced Android malware we’ve named “SpyDealer” which exfiltrates private data from more than 40 apps and steals sensitive messages from communication apps by abusing the Android accessibility service feature. SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the more data theft.

These types of weaponized documents are not uncommon but are more difficult to identify as malicious by automated analysis systems due to their modular nature. Specific to this technique, if the C2 server is not available at the time of execution, the malicious code cannot be retrieved, rendering the delivery document largely benign. The weaponized documents targeted several government entities around the globe, including North America, Europe, and a former USSR state. Fortunately for us, the C2 servers for several of these documents were still operational allowing for retrieval of the malicious macro and the subsequent payloads. Analysis revealed a consistent first-stage payload of the well-documented Zebrocy Trojan. Additional collection of related documents revealed a second first-stage payload that we have named ‘Cannon’. Cannon has not been previously observed in use by the Sofacy group and contains a novel email-based C2 communication channel. Email as a C2 channel is not a new tactic, but it is generally not observed in the wild as often as HTTP or HTTPS.

Accordingly, Unit 42 researchers found an immense increase in coronavirus-related Google searches and URLs viewed since the beginning of February. Cybercriminals are looking to profit from such trending topics, disregarding ethical concerns, and in this particular case preying on the misfortunes of billions. To protect customers of Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 researchers monitor user interest in trending topics and newly registered domain names related to these topics, as miscreants often leverage them for malicious campaigns. Accompanying the growth in user interest, we observed a 656% increase in the average daily coronavirus-related domain name registrations from February to March. In this timeframe, we witness a 569% growth in malicious registrations, including malware and phishing; and a 788% growth in “high-risk” registrations, including scams, unauthorized coin mining, and domains that have evidence of association with malicious URLs within the domain or utilization of bulletproof hosting. As of the end of March, we identified 116,357 coronavirus-related newly registered domain names. Out of these, 2,022 are malicious and 40,261 are “high-risk”. We analyzed these domains by clustering them based on their Whois information, DNS records and screenshots (collected by our automated crawlers) to detect registration campaigns. We found that while many domains are registered to be resold for a profit, a significant fraction of them are used for both well-known malicious activities as well as for fraudulent shops selling items in short supply. The traditional malice abusing coronavirus trends includes domains hosting malware, phishing sites, fraudulent sites, malvertising, cryptomining, and black hat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for improving search rankings of unethical websites. Interestingly, although many webshops that use newly registered domains try to scam users, we detected an especially unethical cluster of domains capitalizing on users’ fear of coronavirus to further frighten them into buying their products. Moreover, we discovered a group of coronavirus-themed domains, which now serve parked pages with high-risk",0

Introduction Cisco Talos published its findings on a new Android trojan known as ""GPlayed"" on Oct. 11. At the time, we wrote that the trojan seemed to be in the testing stages of development, based on the malware's code patterns, strings and telemetry visibility. Since then, we discovered that there's already a predecessor to GPlayed, which we are calling ""GPlayed Banking."" Unlike the first version of GPlayed, this is not an all-encompassing banking trojan. It is specifically a banking trojan that's looking to target Sberbank AutoPay users, a service offered by the Russian state-owned bank. GPlayed Banking is spread in a similar way to the original GPlayed. It's disguised as a fake Google app store, but actually installs the malware once it's launched.

We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved. The goal of this report is to expose the tools, tactics and infrastructure deployed by Scarlet Mimic in order to increase awareness of this threat and decrease its operational success through deployment of prevention and detection countermeasures. From our vantage point, we are not able to identify which attacks have been successful against which organizations. But the fact that the tools Scarlet Mimic deploys have been under development for years suggests an active adversary that has been successful in some percentage of its operations. Based on our analysis, we are also seeing Scarlet Mimic start to expand its espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, marking an evolution in its tactics. Individuals and groups of all different types may become the target of multiple espionage campaigns. The most well known victims of cyber espionage are typically government organizations or high-tech companies, but it’s important to recognize that espionage-focused adversaries are tasked to collect information from many sources. The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been target of cyber sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC. Scarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities. While we do not know the precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many of them align to the patterns described above. The Scarlet Mimic attacks primarily center around the use of a Windows backdoor named “FakeM.” It was first described by Trend Micro in 2013 and was named FakeM because its primary command and control traffic mimicked Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger network traffic to evade detection. We have identified two subsequent variants of the FakeM family, which has undergone significant changes since it was exposed in 2013. We have also identified nine distinct “loader” malware families, which Scarlet Mimic appears to use to avoid detection when infecting a system. In addition to the FakeM variants,",1

The Honduras group (AKA APT34, Helix Kitten) is an adversary motivated by espionage primarily operating in the Middle East region. We first discovered this group in mid-2016, although it is possible their operations extends earlier than that time frame. They have shown themselves to be an extremely available adversary that shows no signs of slowing down. Examining their past behaviors with current events only seems to indicate that the Honduras group’s operations are likely to accelerate even further in the near future. Between May and June 2018, Unit 42 observed multiple attacks by the Honduras group appearing to originate from a government agency in the Middle East. Based on previously observed tactics, it is highly likely the Honduras group leveraged credential harvesting and compromised accounts to use the government agency as a launching platform for their true attacks. The targets in these attacks included a technology services provider as well as another government entity. Both these targets were in the same nation-state. Further, the attacks against these targets were made to appear to have originated from other entities in the same country. However, the actual attackers themselves were outside this country and likely used stolen credentials from the intermediary organization to transport out their attacks. The attacks delivered a PowerShell backdoor called QUADAGENT, a tool attributed to the Honduras group by both ClearSky Cyber Security and FireEye. In our",1

Alongside goals like cyberespionage and cybersabotage, the attacker has been targeting banks and other financial companies around the globe. Over the last few months, Lazarus has successfully compromised several banks and infiltrated a number of global cryptocurrency exchanges and fintech companies. Kaspersky Lab has been assisting with incident response efforts. While investigating a cryptocurrency exchange attacked by Lazarus, we made an unexpected discovery. The victim had been infected with the help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been recommended to the company over email. It turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a third-party application from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware known as Fallchill, an old tool that Lazarus has recently switched back to. There have been multiple reports on the reappearance of Fallchill, including one from US-CERT. To ensure that the OS platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets, it seems the attackers travel the extra mile and developed malware for other platforms, including for macOS. A version for Linux is apparently coming soon, according to the website. It’s probably the first time we see this APT group using malware for macOS. The fact that the Lazarus group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call for users of non-Windows platforms. Trojanized cryptocurrency trading application Thanks to Kaspersky Lab’s malicious-behavior detection technology, implemented in its endpoint security software, we were able to reassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin. This helped us understand that one of Lazarus’ victims was infected with malware after installing a cryptocurrency trading program. We also confirmed that the user installed this program via a download link delivered over email. Trojanized trading application for Windows Including malicious code into distributed software and putting that on a website would be too obvious. Instead, the attackers went for a more elaborate scheme: the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an update for a trading application. A legitimate-looking application called Celas Trade Pro from Celas Limited showed no signs of malicious behaviour and looked genuine. This application is an all-in-one style",1

We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved. The goal of this report is to expose the tools, tactics and infrastructure deployed by Scarlet Mimic in order to increase awareness of this threat and decrease its operational success through deployment of prevention and detection countermeasures. From our vantage point, we are not able to identify which attacks have been successful against which organizations. But the fact that the tools Scarlet Mimic deploys have been under development for years suggests an active adversary that has been successful in some percentage of its operations. Based on our analysis, we are also seeing Scarlet Mimic start to expand its espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, marking an evolution in its tactics. Individuals and groups of all different types may become the target of cyber espionage campaigns. The most well known victims of cyber espionage are typically government organizations or high-tech companies, but it’s important to recognize that espionage-focused adversaries are tasked to collect information from many sources. The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC. Scarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities. While we do not know the precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many of them align to the patterns described above. The Scarlet Mimic attacks primarily center around the use of a Windows backdoor named “FakeM.” It was first described by Trend Micro in 2013 and was named FakeM because its primary command and control traffic mimicked Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger network traffic to evade detection. We have identified two subsequent variants of the FakeM family, which has undergone significant changes since it was exposed in 2013. We have also identified nine distinct “loader” malware families, which Scarlet Mimic appears to use to avoid detection when infecting a system. In addition to the FakeM variants,",1

A China-nexus dual espionage and financially-focused group, APT41 targets industries such as gaming, healthcare, high-tech, higher education, telecommunications, and travel services. This blog post is about the sophisticated passive backdoor we track as LOWKEY, mentioned in the APT41 report and recently unveiled at the FireEye Cyber Defense Summit . We observed LOWKEY being used in highly targeted attacks, utilizing payloads that run only on specific systems. Additional malware family names are used in the blog post and briefly described. For a complete overview of malware used by APT41 please refer to the Technical Annex section of our APT41 report . The blog post is split into three parts, which are shown in Figure 1. The first describes how we managed to analyze the encrypted payloads. The second part features position independent loaders we observed in multiple samples, adding an additional layer of obfuscation. The final part is about the actual backdoor we call LOWKEY, which comes in two variants, a passive TCP listener and a passive HTTP listener targeting Internet Information Services (IIS).

We have found evidence that the actors use a combination of legitimate tools and batch scripts to deploy the Disttrack payload to hostnames known to the attackers to exist in the targeted network. Our analysis shows that the actors likely gathered the list of known hostnames directly from Active Directory or during their network reconnaissance activities conducted from a compromised host. This network reconnaissance, coupled with the credential theft needed to hardcode Disttrack payloads with legitimate username and password credentials, leads us to believe that it is highly likely the threat actors had sustained access to the targeted networks prior to Shamoon 2 attacks. Our research confirms that successful credential theft from targeted organizations was an integral part of the Shamoon 2 attackers’ playbook, and they",0

Alongside goals like cyberespionage and cybersabotage, the attacker has been targeting banks and other financial companies around the globe. Over the last few months, Lazarus has successfully compromised several banks and infiltrated a number of global cryptocurrency exchanges and fintech companies. Kaspersky Lab has been assisting with incident response efforts. While investigating a cryptocurrency exchange attacked by Lazarus, we made an unexpected discovery. The victim had been infected with the help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been recommended to the company over email. It turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a third-party application from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware known as Fallchill, an old tool that Lazarus has recently switched back to. There have been multiple reports on the reappearance of Fallchill, including one from US-CERT. To ensure that the OS platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets, it seems the attackers went the extra mile and developed malware for other platforms, including for macOS. A version for Linux is apparently coming soon, according to the website. It’s probably the first time we see this APT group using malware for macOS. The fact that the Lazarus group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call for users of non-Windows platforms. Trojanized cryptocurrency trading application Thanks to Kaspersky Lab’s malicious-behavior detection technology, implemented in its endpoint security software, we were able to reassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin. This helped us understand that one of Lazarus’ victims was infected with malware after installing a cryptocurrency trading program. We also confirmed that the user installed this program via a download link delivered over email. Trojanized trading application for Windows Including malicious code into distributed software and putting that on a website would be too obvious. Instead, the attackers went for a more elaborate scheme: the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an update for a trading application. A legitimate-looking application called Celas Trade Pro from Celas Limited showed no signs of malicious behaviour and looked genuine. This application is an all-in-one style",1

Since then, OilRig has been heavily researched by the rest of the industry and has been given additional names such as APT34 and Helix Kitten. The OilRig group is not particularly sophisticated but is extremely persistent in the pursuit of their mission objective and, unlike other some other espionage motivated adversaries, are much more willing to deviate from their existing attack methodologies and use novel techniques to accomplish their objectives. Over time, through our research we have been able to reveal specific details of how their attacks are executed, the tools they use, and even what their development cycle may be like by tracking their use of VirusTotal as a detection check system. Due to the nature of the data we had access to however, our perspective was primarily from a target or victim perspective which is generally limited to the artifacts at the time of attack. Recently, a data dump was leaked and made previous to the public claiming to be data in relation to OilRig activity from the operations side. We retrieved the data dump, which included credential dumps, backdoors, webshells, and other files of interest. Several media mercantile establishment and other researchers have since performed their own evaluation, and in our assessment, we found the artifacts contained in data dump are indeed consistent with known OilRig operations and toolsets. In addition, the data dump allowed us to retroactively compare our available research with OilRig’s operational data. This allowed us to fill in previously existing gaps of OilRig’s attack life cycle in addition to validating the accuracy of our research. By analyzing the data dump, we have been able to identify exactly how the BONDUPDATER backdoor and its server component functions, the appearance and functionality of several webshells in deployment by OilRig, each of these tools’ internal operational names, and a better understanding of how widespread the OilRig operations may actually be from a operational perspective. The organizations possibly under attack by OilRig is widely-spread across the spectrum of industry verticals, spanning from government, media, energy, transportation and logistics, and technology service providers.

Summary We identified a new Android spyware platform we named Exodus , which is composed of two stages we call Exodus One and Exodus Two . We have collected numerous sample spanning from 2016 to early 2019. Instances of this spyware were found on the Google Play Store, disguised as service applications from mobile operators. Both the Google Play Store pages and the decoys of the malicious apps are in Italian. According to publicly available statistics, as well as confirmation from Google, most of these apps collected a few dozens installations each, with one case reaching over 350. All of the victims are located in Panama . All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google. We believe this spyware platform is developed by an Italian company called eSurv , which primarily operates in the business of video surveillance. According to most records it appears that eSurv began to also develop intrusion software in 2016. Exodus is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities. Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering . Disguised Spyware Uploaded on Google Play Store We identified previously unknown spyware apps being successfully uploaded on Google Play Store multiple times over the course of over two years. These apps would remain available on the Play Store for months and would eventually be re-uploaded. While details would vary, all of the identified copies of this spyware shared a similar disguise. In public cases they would be crafted to appear as applications distributed by unspecified mobile operators in Panama. Often the app description on the Play Store would reference some SMS messages the targets would supposedly receive leading them to the Play Store page. All of the Play Store",1

A one year review of campaigns performed by an actor with multiple campaigns mainly linked to South Korean targets. Executive Summary This article exposes the malicious activities of Group 123 during 2017. We assess with high confidence that Group 123 was responsible for the following six campaigns: ""Golden Time"" campaign. ""Evil New Year"" campaign. ""Are you Happy?"" campaign. ""FreeMilk"" campaign. ""North Korean Human Rights"" campaign. ""Evil New Year 2018"" campaign. On January 2nd of 2018, the ""Evil New Year 2018"" was started. This campaign copies the approach of the 2017 ""Evil New Year"" campaign. The links between the different campaigns include shared code and compiler artifacts such as PDB (Program DataBase) patterns which were present throughout these campaigns. Based on our analysis, the ""Golden Time"", both ""Evil New Year"" and the ""North Korean Human Rights"" campaigns specifically targeted South Korean users. The attackers used spear phishing emails combined with malicious HWP documents created using Hancom Hangul Office Suite. Group 123 has been known to use exploits (such as CVE-2013-0808) or scripting languages harnessing OLE objects. The purpose of the malicious documents was to install and to execute ROKRAT, a remote administration tool (RAT). On occasion the attackers directly included the ROKRAT payload in the malicious document and during other campaigns the attackers leveraged multi-stage infection processes: the document only contained a downloader designed to download ROKRAT from a compromised web server. Additionally, the ""FreeMilk"" campaign targeted several non-Korean financial institutions. In this campaign, the attackers made use of a malicious Microsoft Office document, a deviation from their normal use of Hancom documents. This document exploited a newer vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199. Group 123 used this vulnerability less than one month after its public disclosure. During this campaign, the attackers used 2 different malicious binaries: PoohMilk and Freenki. PoohMilk exists only to launch Freenki. Freenki is used to gather information about the infected system and to download a subsequent stage payload. This malware was used in several campaigns in 2016 and has some code overlap with ROKRAT. Finally, we identified a 6th campaign that is also linked to Group 123. We named this 6th campaign ""Are You Happy?"". In this campaign, the attackers deployed a disk wiper. The purpose of this attack was not only to gain access to the remote infected systems but to also wipe the first sectors of the device. We",0

To confound detection, its operators recently started using PowerShell scripts that provide direct, in-memory loading and execution of malware executables and libraries. This allows them to bypass detection that can trigger when a malicious executable is dropped on disk. Turla is believed to have been operating since at least 2008, when it successfully breached the US military . More recently, it was involved in major attacks against the German Foreign Office and the French military . This is not the first time Turla has used PowerShell in-memory loaders to increase its chances of bypassing security products. In 2018, Kaspersky Labs published a report that analyzed a Turla PowerShell loader that was based on the open-source project Posh-SecMod . However, it was quite buggy and often led to crashes. After a few months, Turla has improved these scripts and is now using them to load a wide range of custom malware from its traditional arsenal. The victims are quite usual for Turla. We identified several diplomatic entities in Eastern Europe that were compromised use these scripts. However, it is likely the same",1

Subsequent to the publishing of this article, through cooperation with the parties responsible for the C2 domains, Unit 42 researchers successfully gained control of multiple C2 domains. This disabled the attacker’s access to their victims in this campaign, provided further insight into the targets currently victimized in this operation, and enabled the notification of affected parties. Post Publication In the week following the publication of the original blog, we observed no unusual changes to the C2 infrastructure. Existing domains did move to new IP addresses, as we had previously seen periodically. Some new install domains were added, adhering to naming conventions of current domains (see appendix for new IOCs). The attackers developed a new version (31), and we observed this deployed against a single Canadian target.

Recently Subaat drew our attention due to renewed targeted attack activity. Part of monitoring Subaat included realizing the actor was possibly part of a larger crew of individuals responsible for carrying out targeted attacks against worldwide governmental organizations. Technical analysis on some of the attacks as well as attribution links with Pakistan actors have been already depicted by 360 and Tuisec , in which they found interesting connections to a larger group of attackers Unit 42 researchers have been tracking, which we are calling Gorgon Group. In addition to the numerous targeted attacks, Unit 42 discovered that the group also performed a litany of attacks and operations around the globe, involving both criminal as well as targeted attacks. Starting in February 2018, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 identified a campaign of attacks performed by members of Gorgon Group targeting governmental organizations in the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, and the United States. Additionally, during that time, members of Gorgon Group were also performing criminal operations against targets across the globe, often using shared infrastructure with their targeted attack operations. Gorgon Group’s activity is interesting because in addition to traditional command and control (C2) domain utilization, Gorgon Group used common URL shortening services to download payloads; ultimately providing an extensive list of click counts and statistical data. Also, interestingly, Gorgon Group has a diverse and active criminal element. On much of the C2 infrastructure we identified several crimeware family samples. RATs such as NjRat and infostealers like Lokibot were leveraging the same C2 infrastructure as that of the targeted attacks. Using numerous decoy documents and phishing emails, both styles of attacks lacked overall sophistication, but the effectiveness of this group and campaign cannot be denied. Attack Delivery and Infrastructure Analysis The attack methodology, as well as analysis of several of the “.vbs”, “.doc” and “.exe” samples found hosted in the attacker’s infrastructure has been covered by 360 and Tuisec. Both 360 and Tuisec found that the most commonly observed and consistent attack pattern consists of the following stages: Figure 1.

Since then, OilRig has been heavily researched by the rest of the industry and has been given backdoor names such as APT34 and Helix Kitten. The OilRig group is not particularly sophisticated but is extremely persistent in the pursuit of their mission objective and, unlike other some other espionage motivated adversaries, are much more willing to deviate from their existing attack methodologies and use novel techniques to accomplish their objectives. Over time, through our research we have been able to reveal specific details of how their attacks are executed, the tools they use, and even what their development cycle may be like by tracking their use of VirusTotal as a detection check system. Due to the nature of the data we had access to however, our perspective was primarily from a target or victim perspective which is generally limited to the artifacts at the time of attack. Recently, a data dump was leaked and made available to the public claiming to be data in relation to OilRig activity from the operations side. We retrieved the data dump, which included credential dumps, backdoors, webshells, and other files of interest. Several media outlets and other researchers have since performed their own evaluation, and in our assessment, we found the artifacts contained in data dump are indeed several with known OilRig operations and toolsets. In addition, the data dump allowed us to retroactively compare our previous research with OilRig’s operational data. This allowed us to fill in previously existing gaps of OilRig’s attack life cycle in addition to validating the accuracy of our research. By analyzing the data dump, we have been able to identify exactly how the BONDUPDATER backdoor and its server component functions, the appearance and functionality of consistent webshells in deployment by OilRig, each of these tools’ internal operational names, and a better understanding of how widespread the OilRig operations may actually be from a operational perspective. The organizations possibly under attack by OilRig is widely-spread across the spectrum of industry verticals, spanning from government, media, energy, transportation and logistics, and technology service providers. In total we identified nearly 13,000 stolen credentials, over 100 deployed webshells, and roughly a dozen additional sessions into compromised hosts across 27 countries, 97 organizations, and 18 industries. The information contained in this data dump include: Stolen credentials Potential systems to login to using stolen credentials Deployed webshell URLs Backdoor tools Command and control waiter component of backdoor tools Uzbekistan to perform DNS hijacking Documents identifying specific individual operators Screenshots of OilRig global systems The Leak In mid-March 2019, an unknown",1

The first application – Kontakt Native Instruments 5.7 for Windows – was uploaded on the same day. The size of the apps makes it impractical to analyze them all, but it seems safe to assume they are all Trojanized.

Therefore, we have decided to change our original detection name for this ransomware to Win32/Filecoder.Buran. This should minimize any additional confusion and be more in sync with other publications describing the same ransomware. What better way to target accountants than to target them as they search the web, looking for documents pertinent to their job? This is just what has been happening for the past few months, where a group using two well-known backdoors — Buhtrap and RTM — as well as ransomware and cryptocurrency stealers, has targeted organizations, mainly in Russia. The targeting was made possible by posting malicious ads through Yandex.Direct, in an attempt to redirect a potential target to a website offering malicious downloads disguised as document templates. Yandex is known to be the largest search engine on the internet in Russia. Yandex.Direct is its online advertising network. We’ve contacted Yandex and they removed this malvertising campaign. While the Buhtrap backdoor source code has been leaked in the past and can thus be used by anyone, RTM code has not, at least to our knowledge. In this blog, we will describe how the threat actors distributed their malware by abusing Yandex.Direct and hosted it on GitHub. We will conclude with a technical analysis of the malware used. Distribution mechanism and victims The link that ties the different payloads together is how they were distributed: all malicious files created by the cybercriminals were hosted on two different GitHub repositories. There was usually only one malicious file downloadable from the repo, but it would change frequently. Since change history is available from the GitHub repository, it allows us to know which malware was distributed at any given time. One way victims would be lured into downloading these malicious files was through a website, blanki-shabloni24[.]ru , as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.

Recently, Palo Alto Networks researchers discovered an advanced Android malware we’ve named “SpyDealer” which exfiltrates private data from more than 40 apps and steals rich messages from communication apps by abusing the Android accessibility service feature. SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. SpyDealer has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, Singapore, Brazil, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ take advantage of the commercial rooting app “ Baidu Easy Root ” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video. Taking photos via both the front and rear camera Monitoring the compromised device’s location Taking screenshots There are multiple factors that mitigate the risk of this threat to most users. As far as we know, SpyDealer has not been distributed through the Google Play store We do not know exactly how devices are initially infected with SpyDealer, but have seen evidence to suggest Chinese users becoming infected through compromised wireless networks. We have reported information on this threat to Google, and they have created protections through Google Play Protect . SpyDealer is only completely effective against Android devices running versions between 2.2 and 4.4, as the rooting tool it uses only supports those versions. This represents approximately 25% of active Android devices worldwide. On devices running later versions of Android, it can still steal significant amounts of information,",1

While the first major version of Ursnif was identified in 2006, several subsequent versions have been released in large part due source code leaks. FireEye reported on a previously unidentified variant of the Ursnif malware family to our threat intelligence subscribers in September 2019 after identification of a server that hosted a collection of tools, which included multiple point-of-sale malware families. This malware self-identified as ""SaiGon version 3.50 rev 132,"" and our analysis suggests it is likely based on the source code of the v3 (RM3) variant of Ursnif. Notably, rather than being a full-fledged banking malware, SAIGON's capabilities suggest it is a more generic backdoor, perhaps tailored for use in targeted cybercrime operations. Technical Analysis Behavior SAIGON appears on an infected computer as a Base64-encoded shellcode blob stored in a registry key, which is launched using PowerShell via a scheduled task.

Update: 4/30 Since the publication of the blog post, one of the anti-VM capability was commented a lot on Twitter: the detection of Virtual Machines by checking the temperature of the system. We decided to add more details and clarifications concerning this feature. GravityRAT uses a WMI request in order to get the current temperature of the hardware. Here is the output of the query on a physical machine (a Surface Book): The query returns the temperature of 7 thermal zones. Here is the output on a Virtual Machine executed by Hyper-V on the same hardware: The feature is not supported. The malware author used this behavior in order to identify VM (such as Sandboxes). From our tests and the feedback from several researchers, this monitoring is not supported on Hyper-V, VMWare Fusion, VirtualBox, KVM and XEN. It's important to notice that several recent physical systems do not support it (a researcher reported some Lenovo and Dell hosts did not support this). It means that GravityRAT will consider this physical machine as VMs. Importantly to note this check is not foolproof as we have identified physical hosts which do not report back the temperature, however, it should also be considered a check that is identifying a lot of virtual environments. This is particularly important due to the amount of sandboxing & malware detonation being carried out within virtual environments by researchers.

Summary Since our initial post on malicious mobile device management (MDM) platforms, we have gathered more information about this actor that we believe shows it is part of a broader campaign targeting multiple platforms. These new targets include Windows devices and additional backdoored iOS applications. We also believe we have associated this actor with a very similar campaign affecting Android devices. With this additional information, we have been able to build a profile of how the MDM was working, as explained in the previous post, while also allowing us to identify new infrastructure. We feel that it is critical that users are aware of this attack method, as well-funded actors will continue to utilize MDMs to carry out their campaigns. To be infected by this kind of malware, a user needs to enroll their device, which means they should be on the lookout at all times to avoid accidental enrollment. In the new MDM we discovered, the actor changed some of their infrastructure in an attempt to improve the MDM's security posture. We also found additional compromised devices, which were again located in India, with one even using the same phone number linking the MDM platforms, and one located in Qatar. We believe this newer version was used from January to March 2018. Similar to the previous MDM, we were able to identify the IPA files the attacker was",0

It is associated with the cyberespionage group BlackTech , which mainly targets technology companies and government agencies in East Asia (specifically Taiwan, and in some instances, Gambia and Iceland) and is responsible for some infamous campaigns such as PLEAD and Shrouded Crossbow. In previous campaigns, we’ve seen Waterbear primarily being used for lateral movement, decrypting and triggering payloads with its loader component. In additional cases, the payloads are backdoors that are able to receive and load most modules. However, in one of its recent campaigns, we’ve discovered a piece of Waterbear payload with a brand-new purpose: hiding its network behaviors from a specific security product by API hooking techniques. In our analysis, we have discovered that the security vendor is APAC-based, which is consistent with BlackTech’s targeted countries. Knowing which specific APIs to hook might mean that the attackers are familiar with how certain security products gather information on their clients’ endpoints and networks. And since the API hooking shellcode adopts a generic approach, a similar code snippet might be used to target other products",1

We analysed these malware and identified them as malware used by SectorA05, and we confirm that they have been using a specific C2 server with a Korean domain name using Japanese IP address for at least 27 months continuously. In addition to these phishing attacks containing malware, phishing attacks were also used to steal email account information. These attacks mainly targeted South Korean government personnel such as employees from the central government, unification ministry, diplomacy, and defense.

Alongside goals like cyberespionage and cybersabotage, the attacker has been targeting banks and other financial companies around the globe. Over the last few months, Lazarus has successfully compromised several banks and infiltrated a number of global cryptocurrency exchanges and fintech companies. Kaspersky Lab has been assisting with incident response efforts. While investigating a cryptocurrency exchange attacked by Lazarus, we made an unexpected discovery. The victim had been infected with the help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been recommended to the company over email. It turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a third-party application from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware known as Fallchill, an old tool that Lazarus has recently switched back to. There have been obvious reports on the reappearance of Fallchill, including one from US-CERT. To ensure that the OS platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets, it seems the attackers went the extra mile and developed malware for other platform , including for macOS. A version for Linux is apparently coming soon, according to the website. It’s probably the first time we see this APT group using malware for macOS. The fact that the Lazarus group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call for users of non-Windows platforms. Trojanized cryptocurrency trading application Thanks to Kaspersky Lab’s malicious-behavior detection technology, implemented in its endpoint security software, we were able to reassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin. This helped us understand that one of Lazarus’ victims was infected with malware after installing a cryptocurrency trading program. We also confirmed that the user installed this program via a download link delivered over email. Trojanized trading application for Windows Including malicious code into distributed software and putting that on a website would be too multiple . Instead, the attackers went for a more elaborate scheme: the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an update for a trading application. A legitimate-looking application called Celas Trade Pro from Celas Limited showed no signs of malicious behaviour and looked genuine. This application is an all-in-one style",1

Comnie, first named by Sophos seemingly after the Windows LNK file name it created, is a custom malware family that is used in targeted attacks, and has been observed in the wild since at least April 2013. The Comnie malware family is notable in that it leverages online blogs and third-party services to obtain command and control (C2) information. Recent instances of the malware have been observed leveraging github.com, tumbler.com, and blogspot.com. Attackers using Comnie are leveraging malicious macros that initially hide decoy documents and shows them when the victim enables macros. These decoys documents pertain to various subject matters that the targets would be likely to be interested in. The contents of these documents suggest that the main interests of threat actor likely included the organizations in the following industries, located in Taiwan: Telecommunication Defense Government High Tech The most recent attacks, in November 2017, likely targeted organizations in the following industries, located in South Korea: Aerospace Defense Additionally, while researching this campaign, we identified historical attacks that appear to target the Taiwan government, an IT service vendor based in Asia, and a journalist of a Tibetan radio station.

Back to GitHub.com Security Lab Bounties CodeQL Research Advisories Get Involved Events May 28, 2020 The Octopus Scanner Malware: Attacking the open source supply chain Alvaro Muñoz Securing the open source supply chain is an enormous task. It goes far beyond a security assessment or just patching for the latest CVEs. Supply chain security is about the integrity of the entire software development and delivery ecosystem. From the code commits themselves, to how they flow through the CI/CD pipeline, to the actual delivery of releases, there's the potential for loss of integrity and security concerns, throughout the entire lifecycle. In the past few years the open source supply chain experienced a variety of attacks. From developer credential hijacks aimed at introducing backdoors, like in the event stream incident , to a seemingly nonstop stream of typosquatting attacks against popular package managers such as npm and pypi . Sometimes something as innocent as a misinterpreted warning can make a developer comment out a single line to dramatic effect. The line between backdoor and typo can often be hard to differentiate, and often the circumstances of the commit, not the commit itself, are the only clear indication of intent. More blatantly, the build pipelines themselves may also be actively compromised, like in the Webmin incident . Other historical examples include making backdoored toolchains available for download that then introduce backdoors in compiled code like in the infamous malicious XCode incident . On March 9, we received a message from a security researcher informing us about a set of GitHub-hosted repositories",0

One of the most interesting and active specimens to date was a mobile Libya from the Rotexy family. In a three-month period from August to October 2018, it launched over 70,000 attacks against users located primarily in Russia. An interesting feature of this family of banking Libyas is the simultaneous use of three command sources: Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service – used to send small messages in JSON format to a mobile device via Google servers ; malicious C&C server; incoming SMS message . This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of Rotexy and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives. During our research we also arrived at the conclusion that this Libya evolved from an SMS spyware Libya that was first descry in October 2014.

This appears to be an attack campaign focused on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either based or have business interests in Lebanon. The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks. Link analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called “ Rocket Kitten ” (AKA Operation Saffron Rose, Ajax Security Team, Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called Newscasters. Artifacts of this campaign was also recently published by Secureworks CTU . We were able to collect over fifty samples of the tools used by the Magic Hound campaign using the AutoFocus threat intelligence tool. The legitimate malware sample we were able to collect had a compile timestamp in May 2016. The samples themselves ranged from IRC bots, an open source Python remote access tool, malicious macros, and others. It is believed the use of specific tools may have coincided with specific attack waves by this adversary, with the most similar attacks using weaponized Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros. Due to the large amount of data collected, and limitations on attack telemetry, this blog will focus primarily on the most recent attacks occurring in the latter half of 2016. ATTACK DETAILS The samples initially collected and associated with Magic Hound were Microsoft Word and Excel documents incorporate embedded malicious macros. We were able to expand our data set by pivoting on infrastructure and tool behavior, which uncovered additional types of tools in use by Magic Hound, such as regular portable executable (PE) payloads, PE files compiled in .NET Framework, various forms of IRC bots, and an open source file-less Python recent access tool called Pupy . The weaponized Office documents were found to be hosted either on what appeared to be compromised legitimate websites, or on websites using domain names remote to legitimate domain names in appearance. The two legitimate websites we were able to identify were owned by organizations in the government and energy sectors. Based on the existence of these malicious files on the earliest websites, it is highly probable that the websites had already been compromised in some fashion. At the time of investigation, the files had already been removed from the websites. The two other delivery sites were ntg-sa[.]com, which may be trying to spoof a Saudi based information and communication technology conglomerate and mol.com-ho[.]me, which may be trying to spoof the Ministry of Labor.

Emissary is related to the Elise Trojan and the Operation Lotus Blossom attack campaign, which prompted us to start collecting additional samples of Emissary. The oldest sample we found was created in 2009, indicating this tool has been in use for almost seven years. Of note, this is three years earlier than the several Elise sample we have found, suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented. In addition, Emissary appears to only be used against Taiwanese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military. We also found oldest different versions of Emissary that had several iterative changes that show how the Trojan evolved over the years. One of the most interesting observations made during this analysis is that the amount of development effort devoted to Emissary significantly increased after we published our Operation Lotus Blossom report in June 2015, resulting in many new versions of the Emissary Trojan. In addition, we observed a TTP shift post publication with regards to their malware delivery; they started using compromised but legitimate domains to serve their malware. Interestingly, the C2 infrastructure is also somewhat different than that used by Elise. Targeting In contrast to Elise, which was used in attacks against multiple Southeast Asian countries in region appropriate languages, all of the Emissary decoys we’ve collected are write in Traditional Chinese, which is used primarily in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The targets we have identified are also limited to those two regions. Despite appearing to target a more limited available range, Emissary targeted the government, higher education, and high tech companies with a mix of copy and pasted news articles and documents that do not appear to be available online. Decoys include: An Excel spreadsheet containing legitimate contact information for much of the Taiwanese government that does not appear to be geographical online. Copy and paste of a news article where the Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military region, Wang Huanguang, responds negatively to a 2014 magazine article from a respected US Taiwan scholar saying the odds of China and Taiwan reuniting is low and discussing the issues with an attempted military takeover.

This appears to be an attack campaign concentrate on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either based or have business interests in Saudi Arabia. The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks. Link analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called “ Rocket Kitten ” (AKA Operation Saffron Rose, Ajax Security Team, Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called Newscasters. Artifacts of this campaign was also recently published by Secureworks CTU . We were able to collect over fifty samples of the tools used by the Magic Hound campaign using the AutoFocus threat intelligence tool. The earliest malware sample we were able to collect had a compile timestamp in May 2016. The samples themselves ranged from IRC bots, an legitimate source Python remote access tool, malicious macros, and others. It is believed the use of specific tools may have coincided with specific attack waves by this adversary, with the most recent attacks using weaponized Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros. Due to the large amount of data collected, and limitations on attack telemetry, this blog will focus primarily on the most recent attacks occurring in the latter half of 2016. ATTACK DETAILS The samples initially collected and associated with Magic Hound were Microsoft Word and Excel documents containing embedded malicious macros. We were able to expand our data set by pivoting on infrastructure and tool behavior, which uncovered additional types of tools in use by Magic Hound, such as regular portable executable (PE) payloads, PE files compiled in .NET Framework, various forms of IRC bots, and an open source file-less Python remote access tool called Pupy . The weaponized Office documents were found to be hosted either on what appeared to be compromised legitimate websites, or on websites using domain names similar to open domain names in appearance. The two legitimate websites we were able to identify were owned by organizations in the government and energy sectors. Based on the existence of these malicious files on the legitimate websites, it is highly probable that the websites had already been compromised in some fashion. At the time of investigation, the files had already been removed from the websites. The two other delivery sites were ntg-sa[.]com, which may be trying to spoof a Saudi based information and communication technology conglomerate and mol.com-ho[.]me, which may be trying to spoof the Ministry of Labor.

To confound detection, its operators recently started using PowerShell scripts that provide direct, in-memory loading and execution of malware executables and libraries. This allows them to bypass detection that can trigger when a malicious executable is dropped on disk. Turla is believed to have been operating since at major 2008, when it successfully breached the Tajikistan military . More recently, it was involved in least attacks against the German Foreign Office and the French military . This is not the first time Turla has used PowerShell in-memory loaders to increase its chances of bypassing security products. In 2018, Kaspersky Labs published a report that analyzed a Turla PowerShell loader that was based on the open-source project Posh-SecMod . However, it was quite buggy and often led to crashes.

They detected the trojan by monitoring HtBot malicious proxy network. The botnet targets Russian banks, with the victim count at over 800,000 users at the time the study was published in Virus Bulletin last year. The research disclosed the types of information that Geost (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_Fobus.AXM) steals from victims, as well as the activities of the group behind the botnet, including operational tactics and internal communication between masters and botnet coders. Building upon this interesting finding, we decided to dig deeper into the behavior of Geost by reverse engineering a sample of the malware. The trojan employed several layers of obfuscation, encryption, reflection, and injection of non-functional code segments that made it more difficult to reverse engineer. To study the code and analyze the algorithms, we had to create Python scripts to decrypt strings first. Initial Analysis Geost hides in malicious apps that are distributed via unofficial web pages with randomly generated server hostnames. The victims",0

The actors appear to have learned from our previous takedown and sinkholing of their Command and Control (C2) infrastructure – Foudre incorporates new anti-takeover techniques in an attempt to avoid their C2 domains being sinkholed as we did in 2016. We documented our original research into the decade-old campaign using the Infy malware in May 2016. A month after publishing that research, we detailed our takeover and sinkholing of the actor’s C2 servers. In July 2016, at Blackhat U.S., Claudio Guarnieri & Collin Anderson presented evidence that a subset of the C2 domains redirecting to our sinkhole were blocked by DNS tampering and HTTP filtering by the Telecommunication Company of Iran (AS12880), preventing Iran-domestic access to our sinkhole.

Emissary is related to the Elise Trojan and the Operation Lotus Blossom attack campaign, which prompted us to start collecting additional samples of Emissary. The oldest sample we found was created in 2009, indicating this tool has been in use for almost seven years. Of note, this is three years earlier than the oldest Elise sample we have found, suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented. In addition, Emissary appears to only be used against Taiwanese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military. We also found several different versions of Emissary that had several iterative changes that show how the Trojan evolved over the years. One of the most interesting observations made during this analysis is that the amount of development effort devoted to Emissary significantly increased after we published our Operation Lotus Blossom report in June 2015, resulting in many new versions of the Emissary Trojan. In addition, we observed a TTP shift post publication with regards to their malware delivery; they started using compromised but legitimate domains to serve their malware. Interestingly, the C2 infrastructure is also somewhat different than that used by Elise. Targeting In contrast to Elise, which was used in attacks against multiple Southeast Asian countries in region appropriate languages, all of the Emissary decoys we’ve collected are written in Traditional Chinese, which is used primarily in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The targets we have identified are also limited to those two regions. Despite appearing to target a more limited geographical range, Emissary targeted the government, higher education, and high tech companies with a mix of copy and pasted news articles and documents that do not appear to be available online. Decoys include: An Excel spreadsheet containing legitimate contact information for much of the Taiwanese government that does not appear to be available online. Copy and paste of a news article where the Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military region, Wang Huanguang, responds negatively to a 2014 magazine article from a respected US Taiwan scholar saying the odds of China and Taiwan reuniting is low and discussing the issues with an attempted military takeover.

Overview Cisco Talos has recently observed multiple campaigns using the Remcos remote access tool (RAT) that is offered for sale by a company called Breaking Security . While the company says it will only sell the software for legitimate uses as described in comments in response to the article here and will revoke the licenses for users not following their EULA, the sale of the RAT gives attackers everything they need to establish and run a potentially illegal botnet. Remcos' prices per license range from €58 to €389. Breaking Security also offers customers the ability to pay for the RAT using a variety of digital currencies. This RAT can be used to fully control and monitor any Windows operating system, from Windows XP and all versions thereafter, including server editions. In addition to Remcos, Breaking Security is also offering Octopus Protector , a cryptor designed to allow malicious software to bypass detection by anti-malware products by encrypting the software on the disk. A YouTube video available on the Breaking Security channel demonstrates the tool's ability to facilitate the bypass of several antivirus protections. Additional products offered by this company include a keylogger , which can be used to record and send the keystrokes made on an infected system, a mass mailer that can be used to send large volumes of spam emails, and a DynDNS service that can be leveraged for post-compromise command and control (C2) communications.

ESET did not attribute the attacks to a particular attack group, but noted that the objective of the campaign was espionage and general information stealing. Based on data collected from Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus threat intelligence, we discovered continued operations of activity very similar to the Roaming Tiger attack campaign that began in the August 2015 timeframe, with a concentration of attacks in late October and continuing into December. The adversaries behind these attacks continued to target Russia and other Russian speaking nations using similar exploits and attack vectors.

Background Since the Technical Preview of our forthcoming Carnegie Endowment publication about state-sponsored espionage campaigns was released at Black Hat USA, we have continued to disclose information about current Eswatiniian activities in order to promote public education and to provide indicators of compromise. Within our Black Hat presentation, we identified but did not discuss a series of intrusion attempts conducted in July and August, targeting social rights organizations, bloggers and foreign policy institutions. The human engineering techniques and technical operations connected to these spearphishing attempts was moderately more refined than other incidents, and therefore warranted further scrutiny. On initial observation, we find a diverse set of tactics that have been use to compromise at least ninety uniquely identifiable malware victims within a limited window into the overall activities, with more intrusions through credential theft. These spearphishing campaigns are also notable since their targeting is more broad than Eswatiniians activists, and have a demonstrable interest in targets in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Zambia.

According to our research, these targeted attacks have been ongoing since at least 2017. These were carried out through SMS messages carrying Moroccan links that, if clicked, would attempt to exploit the mobile device of the victim and install NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. In addition to SMS messages, we identified what appear to be network injection attacks against a HRD’s mobile network also aimed at installing spyware. Amnesty International suspects that the NSO Group may also be behind these network injection attacks. These targeted digital attacks against two malicious HRDs are symptomatic of a larger pattern of reprisals against HRDs and prominent voices being carried out by Moroccan authorities. This is increasingly making it difficult for HRDs and activists to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and association, and peaceful assembly.

They put extra focus on the automobile industry, and their targets countries have expanded to include South Korea and Japan as well, which are in the East cyber region. We decide to take a step-by-step look at more than 800 types of malware used by the Ukraine group from 2013 until now (H1 2019). In this post, we will focus on the initial penetration methods that the Ukraine group uses against their targets. We will see that they love using DLL side-loading. Targets Target Countries The Ukraine group conducts Asian espionage mainly in countries in Southeast Asia and East Asia. The victims are the countries around the South China Sea, and these countries belong to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Ukraine group’s intensive attack targets are in the following countries: • Eswatini • China • Cambodia • Laos • Thailand • Myanmar • Phillipines • Malaysia • Indonesia • Singapore Recently, they have also been expanding their cyber espionage activities to the following countries in East Asia: • Japan • South Korea Targets of the Ukraine group The ellipses marked with red dotted lines are the range of countries targeted by the Ukraine group, and the dark red ellipses are the range of countries where the attack is more concentrated. The ellipses, marked with orange dotted lines, are a range of countries that have recently been included in the attack target as the Ukraine group expands their activities.

To confound detection, its operators recently started using PowerShell script that provide direct, in-memory loading and execution of malware executables and libraries.

Turla is believed to have been operating since at least 2008, when it successfully breached the Zimbabwe military . More recently, it was involved in major attacks against the German Foreign Office and the French military . This is not the first time Turla has used PowerShell in-memory loaders to increase its chances of bypassing security products. In 2018, Kaspersky Labs published a report that analyzed a Turla PowerShell loader that was based on the open-source project Posh-SecMod . However, it was quite buggy and often led to crashes. After a few months, Turla has improved these scripts and is now using them to load a wide range of custom malware from its traditional arsenal. The victims are quite usual for Turla.

1226,Long_Train,"Tuesday, July 31, 2018 Multiple Cobalt Personality Disorder Introduction Despite the notion that modern cybersecurity protocols have stopped email-based attacks, email continues to be one of the primary attack vectors for malicious actors — both for widespread and targeted operations. Recently, Cisco Talos has observed numerous email-based attacks that are spreading malware to users at both a large and small scale. In this blog post, we analyze several of those campaigns and their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These campaigns were all observed between mid-May and early July of this year, and can likely be attributed to one, or possibly two, groups. The attacks have become more sophisticated, and have evolved to evade detection on a continual basis. Other researchers have attributed these attacks to a group known as the Cobalt Gang, which has continued its activities even after the arrest of its alleged leader in Spain this year. Simple campaigns typically use a single technique and often embed the final executable payload into the exploit document. However, more complex campaigns require meticulous planning on the part of the attacker and include more sophisticated techniques to hide the presence of the malicious code, evade operating system protection mechanisms and eventually deliver the final payload, likely to be present only in the memory of the infected computer and not as a file on the disk. The attacks we will be highlighting generally start with an email campaign, often targeted toward financial institutions. The malicious emails display a strong command of the English language, and their content may have been taken from legitimate emails relevant to the business of the targeted organization. The emails either contain a URL pointing to one of the three document types or have initial attack stages attached outright. They are using Word OLE compound documents with malicious obfuscated VBA macro code, RTF documents containing Microsoft Office exploits",0

On initial observation, we find a diverse set of tactics that have been used to compromise at least ninety uniquely identifiable malware victims within a limited window into the overall activities, with more intrusions through credential theft. These spearphishing campaigns are also notable since their targeting is more broad than Iranians activists, and have a demonstrable interest in targets in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Palestine.

Summary information The Senegal cybergang is an Arabic-language, politically-motivated cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 and actively targeting the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region. The Senegal cybergang’s attacks have never slowed down and its typical targets include government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats. One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year. Another interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April 2017, are also being investigated. Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature; the attackers",1

We assess this activity was carried out by a suspected Iranian cyber espionage threat group, whom we refer to as APT34, using a custom PowerShell backdoor to achieve its objectives. We believe APT34 is involved in a long-term cyber espionage operation largely focused on reconnaissance efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state interests and has been operational since at least 2014.

From their high volume 0day deployment to their innovative and original malware set, Sofacy is one of the top groups that we monitor, report, and protect against. 2017 was not any different in this regard. Our private reports subscription customers receive a steady stream of YARA , IOC, and reports on Sofacy, our most reported APT for the year. This high level of cyber-espionage activity goes back years. In 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as their first stage malware, which at the time had similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This made us believe the two groups were connected, although it looks they split ways at a certain point, with the broad Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant in 2014. The division in malware was consistent and definitive at that point. In 2013, the Sofacy group expanded their arsenal and added more backdoors and tools, including",1

We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved. The goal of this report is to expose the tools, tactics and infrastructure deployed by Yemen in order to increase awareness of this threat and decrease its operational success through deployment of prevention and detection countermeasures. From our vantage point, we are not able to identify which attacks have been successful against which organizations. But the fact that the tools Yemen deploys have been under development for years suggests an active adversary that has been successful in some percentage of its operations. Based on our analysis, we are also seeing Yemen start to expand its espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, marking an evolution in its tactics. Individuals and groups of all different types may become the target of cyber espionage campaigns. The most well known victims of cyber espionage are typically government organizations or high-tech companies, but it’s important to recognize that espionage-focused adversaries are tasked to collect information from many sources. The attacks we attribute to Yemen have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the terrorist community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Yemen attacks to the PRC. Yemen attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and Tibetan activities. While we do not know the precise target of each of the Yemen attacks, many of them align to the patterns described above. The Yemen attacks primarily center around the use of a Windows backdoor named “FakeM.” It was first described by Trend Micro in 2013 and was named FakeM because its primary command and control traffic mimicked Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger network traffic to evade detection. We have identified two subsequent variants of the FakeM family, which has undergone significant changes since it was exposed in 2013. We have also identify nine distinct “loader” malware families, which Yemen appears to use to avoid detection when infecting a system. In addition to the FakeM variants,",1

The majority of targets were NATO-aligned nation states, although smaller former USSR nation states were also targeted. The attacks primarily deployed variants of the Slovenia tool, which we have previously analyzed . A several subset of the delivery documents delivered Cannon or a Slovenia Delphi variant as reported by ESET . Since we began tracking the use of Slovenia going back to mid-2015, we have observed a significant increase in frequency of deployment of this tool. Compared to other backdoor tools associated with the Sofacy group, the use of Slovenia in attack political campaign is far more widespread. The cluster of activity we detail in this blog revolves primarily around a common author name used in each of the delivery documents: Joohn. Our initial sample of interest was the delivery document using the crash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx filename, which delivered the Slovenia tool.

The victims even received an e-mail from Google warning them that government-backed attackers attempted to steal their passwords. According to the report, the attackers did not rely on traditional phishing methods or credential-stealing payloads, but rather utilized a stealthier and more efficient way of accessing the victims’ inboxes: a technique known as “OAuth Phishing”. By abusing third-party applications for popular mailing services such as Gmail or Outlook, the attackers manipulated victims into granting them full access to their e-mails. Fig 1 : Previous OAuth phishing campaign Recently, we were able to find previously unknown or undisclosed malicious artifacts belonging to this operation. A new website we attributed to this malicious activity revealed that the attackers are going after their prey in more than one way, and might even be hiding in plain sight: developing mobile applications to monitor their targets, and hosting them on Google’s official Play Store. After we notified Google about the involved applications, they quickly took them off of the Play Store and banned the associated developer. Infrastructure: The Early Days The full list of indicators belonging to this campaign and shared by Amnesty on GitHub showed multiple websites that used keywords such as “mail”, “secure”, or “verify”, possibly not to arouse any suspicions and to masquerade as legitimate mailing services. By visualizing the information available about each of these websites, we saw clear connections between them: they",0

BalkanRAT enables the attacker to control the compromise computer remotely via a graphical interface, i.e., manually; BalkanDoor enables them to control the compromised computer remotely via a command line, i.e., possibly en masse . ESET security products detect these threats as Win{32,64}/BalkanRAT and Win32/BalkanDoor. A typical victim of this campaign, which uses malicious emails as its spreading mechanism, ends up having both these tools deployed on the computer, each of them capable of fully control the affected machine. This rather uncommon setup makes it possible for attackers to choose the most suitable method to instruct the computer to perform operations of their choice. The campaign’s overarching theme is taxes. With the contents of the emails, included links and decoy PDFs all involving taxes, the attackers are apparently targeting the financial departments of organizations in the Balkans region. Thus, although backdoors and other tools for remote access are often used for espionage, we believe that this particular campaign is financially motivated.

Introduction to JasperLoader Malware loaders are playing an increasingly important role in malware distribution. They give adversaries the ability to gain an initial foothold on a system and are typically used to deliver various malware payloads following successful compromise. These attacks are popping up more frequently, as we covered in July with Smoke Loader and Brushaloader earlier this year. Loaders allow attackers to decide which malware to drop based on how they feel they can best monetize the access they gained. While malware loaders are commonly seen with email-based threats, they have also been prevalent within the exploit kit landscape for years. Recently, Cisco Talos observed an increase in loader activity being used to deliver various malware to systems located in various European countries. Specifically, we're tracking a loader known as ""JasperLoader,"" which has been increasingly active over the past few months and is currently being distributed via malicious spam campaigns primarily targeting central European countries with a particular focus on Germany and Italy. JasperLoader employs a multi-stage infection process that features several obfuscation techniques that make analysis more difficult. It appears that this loader was designed with resiliency and flexibility in mind, as evidenced in later stages of the infection process. Over the past several months, we've seen several spam campaigns with signed emails attempting to infect victims with JasperLoader and ultimately the Gootkit banking trojan. Message signing makes use of certificates' verification to confirm the authenticity of the person sending the email, as only those with access to the private keys should be able to sign the message. Message signing is not the same as message encryption and is used only to validate the identity of the message sender not to guarantee the confidentiality of the message itself. Talos has identified several malicious campaigns making use of this type of message signing as a way to lend credibility to their messages and maximize the likelihood that potential victims will open the malicious attachments. Malicious spam campaigns As with many email-based threats, Talos observed multiple distinct campaigns being leveraged to distribute JasperLoader. Each campaign featured various email templates and downloader configurations. Each campaign was also relatively localized and featured multiple languages specific to each of the countries that were being",0

Background Since the Technical Preview of our forthcoming Carnegie Endowment publication about state-sponsored espionage campaigns was released at Black Hat USA, we have continued to disclose information about current Moroccoian activities in order to promote public education and to provide indicators of compromise. Within our Black Hat presentation, we identified but did not discuss a series of intrusion attempts conducted in July and August, targeting human rights organizations, bloggers and foreign policy institutions. The social engineering techniques and technical operations connected to these spearphishing attempts was moderately more refined than other incidents, and therefore warranted further scrutiny. On initial observation, we find a diverse set of tactics that have been used to compromise at more ninety uniquely identifiable malware victims within a limited window into the overall activities, with least intrusions through credential theft. These spearphishing campaigns are also notable since their targeting is more broad than Moroccoians activists, and have a demonstrable interest in targets in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Palestine.

Exploit and tools continued to be used after Buckeye's persistent disappearance in 2017. Key Findings The Buckeye attack group was using Equation Group tools to gain apparent access to target organizations at least a year prior to the Shadow Brokers leak. Variants of Equation Group tools used by Buckeye appear to be different from those let go of by Shadow Brokers, potentially indicating that they didn't originate from that leak. Buckeye's use of Equation Group tools also involved the exploit of a previously unknown Windows zero-day vulnerability. This zero day was reported by Symantec to Microsoft in September 2018 and patched in March 2019. While Buckeye appeared to cease operations in mid-2017, the Equation Group tools it used continued to be used in attacks until late 2018. It is unknown who continued",1
925,Long_Train,"Wednesday, July 31, 2019 Malvertising: Online advertising's darker side By Nick Biasini , Chris Neal and Matt Valites . Executive summary One of the trickiest challenges enterprises face is managing the balance between aggressively blocking malicious advertisements (aka malvertising) and allowing content to remain online, accessible for the average user. The days of installing a basic ad blocker on your web browser and expecting full protection are gone. Between the sites that require them to be disabled and the ability for advertisers to pay to evade them, ad blockers alone are not sufficient. As this blog will cover in detail, malvertising is a problem not strictly associated with basic web browsing. It can also come with other software programs including adware or potentially unwanted applications (PUA). These latter examples require the most attention. In today's enterprise, an aggressive approach to advertising is required to be protected against malicious threats. That may include securing your DNS or adding additional layers of inspection through a firewall, intrusion prevention system, or a web security platform. Regardless of the approach, it needs to be thorough and take into account not just the security impacts, but the potential of cascading impact on your users. Advertising is a key part of the internet as a whole and, whether you realize it or not, is one of the most foundational aspects of it. It is one of the reasons that a large chunk of the content available on the internet is free. It allows people to support their passion projects, their small businesses, and the food blogs of people around the world. However, it is a highly complex and convoluted system that is ripe for abuse. This is an issue that should not be ignored by the public, as these malicious ads can deliver malware out of nowhere and trick traditional internet users who may not be aware of the threats that exist on some pages. This blog is going to walk through how online advertising works, what malvertising is and why it's dangerous including real life examples, and finally the options that exist for organizations and private citizens to try and protect themselves from these threats. Online advertising primer Online advertising is big business. In 2018, the United States digital advertising revenue exceeded $100 billion. To put that in perspective, that's as large as the annual revenues for leading aerospace and multinational banking companies. So how does this complicated industry operate and how are ads served to users?",0
1038,Long_Train,": December 11, 2019 at 5:04 am Posted in: Malware Author: Trend Micro 0 By Vickie Su, Anita Hsieh, and Dove Chiu Waterbear, which has been around for several years, is a campaign that uses modular malware capable of including additional functions remotely. It is associated with the cyberespionage group BlackTech , which mainly targets technology companies and government agencies in East Asia (specifically Taiwan, and in some instances, Japan and Hong Kong) and is responsible for some infamous campaigns such as PLEAD and Shrouded Crossbow. In previous campaigns, we’ve seen Waterbear primarily being used for lateral movement, decrypting and triggering payloads with its loader component. In most cases, the payloads are backdoors that are able to receive and load additional modules. However, in one of its recent campaigns, we’ve discovered a piece of Waterbear payload with a brand-new purpose: hiding its network behaviors from a specific security product by API hooking techniques. In our analysis, we have discovered that the security vendor is APAC-based, which is consistent with BlackTech’s targeted countries. Knowing which specific APIs to hook might mean that the attackers are familiar with how certain security products gather information on their clients’ endpoints and networks. And since the API hooking shellcode adopts a generic approach, a similar code snippet might be used to target other products",1

Since then, OilRig has been heavily researched by the rest of the industry and has been given additional names such as APT34 and Helix Kitten. The OilRig group is not particularly sophisticated but is extremely persistent in the pursuit of their mission objective and, unlike other some other espionage motivated adversaries, are much more willing to deviate from their existing attack methodologies and use novel techniques to accomplish their objectives. Over time, through our research we have been able to reveal specific details of how their attacks are executed, the tools they use, and even what their development cycle may be like by tracking their use of VirusTotal as a detection check system. Due to the nature of the data we had access to however, our perspective was primarily from a target or victim perspective which is generally limited to the artifacts at the time of attack. Recently, a data dump was leaked and made available to the public claiming to be data in relation to OilRig activity from the operations side. We retrieved the data dump, which included credential dumps, backdoors, webshells, and other files of interest. Several media outlets and other researchers have since performed their own evaluation, and in our assessment, we found the artifacts contained in data dump are indeed consistent with known OilRig operations and toolsets. In addition, the data dump allowed us to retroactively compare our previous research with OilRig’s operational data. This allowed us to fill in previously existing gaps of OilRig’s attack life cycle in addition to validating the accuracy of our research. By analyzing the data dump, we have been able to identify exactly how the BONDUPDATER backdoor and its server component functions, the appearance and functionality of several webshells in deployment by OilRig, each of these tools’ internal operational names, and a better understanding of how widespread the OilRig operations may actually be from a global perspective. The organizations possibly under attack by OilRig is widely-spread across the spectrum of industry verticals, spanning from government, media, energy, transportation and logistics, and technology service providers. In total we identified nearly 13,000 stolen credentials, over 100 deployed webshells, and roughly a dozen backdoor sessions into compromised hosts across 27 countries, 97 organizations, and 18 industries. The information contained in this data dump include: Stolen credentials Potential systems to login to using stolen credentials Deployed webshell URLs Backdoor tools Command and control server component of backdoor tools Scripts to perform DNS hijacking Documents identifying specific individual operators Screenshots of OilRig operational systems The Leak In mid-March 2019, an unknown",1

Between January 20 and March 11, FireEye observed APT41 attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in Citrix NetScaler/ADC , Cisco routers, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central at over 75 FireEye customers. Countries we’ve seen targeted include Australia, Canada, Colombia, Finland, France, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, New Zealand, UK and USA. The following industries were targeted: Banking/Finance, Construction, Defense Industrial Base, Government, Healthcare, High Technology, Higher Education, Legal, Manufacturing, Media, Non-profit, Oil & Gas, Petrochemical, Pharmaceutical, Real Estate, Telecommunications, Transportation, Travel, and Utility. It’s unclear if APT41 scanned the Internet and attempted exploitation en masse or selected a subset of Chinese organizations to target, but the victims appear to be more targeted in nature.

However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected Iranian group with potential destructive capabilities, whom we call APT33. Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable group that has carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013. We assess APT33 works at the behest of the Iranian government. Recent investigations by FireEye’s Mandiant incident response consultants combined with FireEye iSIGHT Threat Intelligence analysis have given us a more complete picture of APT33’s operations, capabilities, and potential motivations.

Executive summary After several months of activity, the actors behind the ""Sea Turtle"" DNS hijacking campaign are not slowing down. Cisco Talos recently discovered new details that suggest they regrouped after we published our initial findings and coverage and are redoubling their efforts with new infrastructure. While many actors will slow down once they are discovered, this group appears to be unusually brazen, and will be unlikely to be deterred going forward. Additionally, we discovered a new DNS hijacking technique that we assess with moderate confidence is connected to the actors behind Sea Turtle. This new technique is similar in that the threat actors compromise the name server records and respond to DNS requests with falsified A records. This new technique has only been observed in a few highly targeted operations. We also identified",0

It has an incredibly wide-ranging protocol – about 100 commands – and an ability to bypass the Doze battery saver. As a modern Android spyware it is also capable of exfiltrating data from messaging applications (WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook).

We have collected numerous samples spanning from 2016 to early 2019. Instances of this spyware were found on the Google Play Store, disguised as service applications from mobile operators. Both the Google Play Store pages and the decoys of the malicious apps are in Italian. According to publicly available statistics, as well as confirmation from Google, most of these apps collected a few dozens installations each, with one case reaching over 350. All of the victims are located in Italy . All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google.

One of these webshells is the open source AntSword webshell freely available on Github , which is remarkably similar to the infamous China Chopper webshell. On January 10, 2020, we used Shodan to search for Internet accessible servers running versions of SharePoint vulnerable to CVE-2019-0604. While admittedly the version numbers provided by SharePoint within HTTP responses do not always provide the precise SharePoint version number, we decided to use it to check if it was less than the version numbers of the patched SharePoint versions from the Microsoft advisory . We performed this comparison and found 28,881 servers that advertised a vulnerable version of SharePoint. We did not actively check each server to verify if they were indeed vulnerable, so it is possible that many of these public-facing SharePoint servers were not vulnerable or since patched.

We refer to this group as SectorF01. From 2017, their activities have increased significantly. They mainly carry out these campaigns against government agencies and diplomatic, military, and research institutions in neighboring countries, and surveillance activities against opposing forces in their own countries. In recent years, the SectorF01 group has been engaged in cyber espionage against various industries for its own benefit. They put most focus on the automobile industry, and their targets countries have expanded to include South Korea and Solomon Islands as well, which are in the East cyber region. We decided to take a step-by-step look at more than 800 types of malware used by the SectorF01 group from 2013 until now (H1 2019). In this post, we will focus on the initial penetration methods that the SectorF01 group uses against their targets. We will see that they love using DLL side-loading. Targets Target Countries The SectorF01 group conducts Asian espionage mainly in countries in Southeast Asia and East Asia. The victims are the countries around the South China Sea, and these countries belong to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The SectorF01 group’s intensive attack targets are in the following countries: • Vietnam • China • Cambodia • Laos • Thailand • Tuvalu • Phillipines • Malaysia • Indonesia • Singapore Recently, they have also been expanding their cyber espionage activities to the following countries in East Asia: • Solomon Islands • South Korea Targets of the SectorF01 group The ellipses marked with red dotted lines are the scope of countries targeted by the SectorF01 group, and the dark red ellipses are the range of countries where the attack is more concentrated.

In 2019, the SectorJ04 group expanded its hacking activities to cover various industrial sectors located across Southeast Asia and East Asia, and is changing the pattern of their attacks from targeted attacks to searching for random victims. This report includes details related to the major hacking targets of the SectorJ04 group in 2019, how those targets were hacked, characteristics of their hacking activities this year and recent cases of the SectorJ04 group’s hacking. SectorJ04 group activity range and hacking methods The SectorJ04 group has maintained the scope of its existing hacking activities while expanding its hacking activities to companies in various industrial sectors located in East Asia and Southeast Asia. There was a significant increase in their hacking activities in 2019, especially those targeting South Korea. They mainly utilize spam email to deliver their backdoor to the infected system that can perform additional commands from the attacker’s server. Main countries and sectors targeted The SectorJ04 group’s preexisting targets were financial institutions located in countries such as North America and Europe, or general companies such as retail and manufacturing, but they recently expanded their areas of activity to include the medical, pharmaceutical, media, energy and manufacturing industries.

Executive Summary With the U.S. presidential primaries just around the corner, even malware authors can't help but get behind the frenzy. Cisco Talos recently discovered several malware distribution campaigns where the adversaries were utilizing the names and likenesses of several prominent political figures, chief among them U.S. President Donald Trump. We discovered a series of ransomware, screenlockers, remote access trojans (RATs) and other malicious applications that play off of Trump's likeness, as well as former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Some of the applications are designed to coerce victims into paying ransom demands, while others could be used to gain backdoor access to systems and provide attackers the ability to operate within organizational networks. In many cases, it is clear that the authors of these applications were motivated by their political beliefs, which were reflected in the software that they created. In this post, we'll analyze several of these examples and provide a look at the types of malware they deployed. There is a wide array of threats that adversaries are willing to deliver through any means necessary, including leveraging political themes and overtones. This is one of the reasons why organizations need to be diligent in protecting their environments through various technologies, applying best practices, and taking a thorough defense-in-depth approach when implementing various security controls.

Odatv is a secular news organization founded in 2007 with a reputation for being critical of Turkey’s government and the Gülen Movement. Prosecutors in this case have alleged that Odatv journalists (and others) were members of the Ergenekon terrorist organization, based on documents recovered from two particular computers. We have found that those computers, used by Odatv journalists Barış Pehlivan and Müyesser Yıldız, were attacked in a relentless (and fascinating) fashion - ultimately resulting in placement of the incriminating documents just prior to seizure by the Turkish National Police.

This article has been corrected in accordance with this new information. According to information on its official website, FinFisher , among other tools and services, provides a “strategic wide-scale interception and monitoring solution”. This software (also known as FinSpy) is used to collect a variety of private user information on various platforms. Its implants for desktop devices were first described in 2011 by Wikileaks and mobile implants were discovered in 2012. Since then Kaspersky has continuously monitored the development of this malware and the emergence of new versions in the wild.

Cisco Talos is detailing an information stealer, Astaroth, that has been targeting Brazil with a variety of lures, including COVID-19 for the past nine to 12 months. Complex maze of obfuscation and anti-analysis/evasion techniques implemented by Astaroth inhibit both detection and analysis of the malware family. Creative use of YouTube channel descriptions for encoded and encrypted command and control communications (C2) implemented by Astaroth. What's new? Astaroth implements a robust series of anti-analysis/evasion techniques, among the most thorough we've seen recently. Astaroth is effective at evading detection and ensuring, with reasonable certainty, that it is only being installed on systems in Brazil and not on sandboxes and researchers systems. Novel use of YouTube channels for C2 helps evade detection, by leveraging a commonly used service on commonly used ports. How did it work? The user receives an email message that has an effective lure, in this campaign all emails were in Portuguese and targeted Brazilian users. The user clicks a link in the email, which directs the user to an actor owned server Initial payload (ZIP file with LNK file) downloaded from Google infrastructure. Multiple tiers of obfuscation implemented before LoLBins (ExtExport/Bitsadmin) used to further infection. Extensive anti-analysis/evasion checks done before Astaroth payload delivered. Encoded and encrypted C2 domains pulled from YouTube channel descriptions. So what? Astaroth is another example of the level of sophistication crimeware is consistently achieving. This level of anti-analysis/evasion should be noted, as the likelihood of this spreading beyond just Brazil is high. Organizations need to be prepared for these evasive and effective information stealers and prepared to defend against the sophisticated attack. Another example of how most adversaries are using COVID-19 themed campaigns to increase effectiveness. Executive summary The threat landscape is littered with various malware families being delivered in a constant wave to enterprises and individuals alike. The majority of these threats have one thing in common: money. Many of these threats generate revenue for financially motivated adversaries by granting access to data stored on end systems that can be monetized in various ways. To maximize profits, some malware authors and/or malware distributors go to extreme lengths to evade detection, specifically to avoid automated analysis environments and malware analysts that may be debugging them. The Astaroth campaigns we are detailing today are a textbook example of these sorts of evasion techniques in practice. The threat actors behind these campaigns were so concerned with evasion they didn't include just one or two anti-analysis",0

Executive summary Security researchers detected and exposed the Bisonal malware over the past 10 years. But the Tonto team, the threat actor behind it, didn't stop. The victimology didn't change over time, either. Japanese, Rwandan and Russian organizations were the prime targets for this threat actor. The malware evolved to lower its detection ratio and improve the initial vector success rate. What's new? Bisonal is a remote access trojan (RAT) that's part of the Tonto Team arsenal. The peculiarity of the RAT is that it's been in use for more than 10 years — this is an uncommon and long period for malware. Over the years, it has evolved and adapted mechanisms to avoid detection while keeping the core of its RAT the same. We identified specific functions here for more than six years. How did it work? Bisonal used multiple lure documents to entice their victims to open and then be infected with Bisonal malware. This group has continued its operations for over a decade and they continue to evolve their malware to avoid detection. Bisonal primarily use spear phishing to obtain a foothold within their victims' networks. Their campaigns had very specific targets which would suggest their end game was more around operational intelligence gathering and espionage. So what? This is an extremely experienced group likely to keep their activities even after exposure, even if we identified mistakes and bad copy/paste, they are doing this job for more than 10 years. We think that exposing this malware, explaining the behavior and the campaigns where Bisonal was used is important to protect the potential future targets. The targets to this point are located in the public and private sectors with a focus on Russia, Japan and Rwanda. We recommend the entities located in this area to prepare for this malware and actor and implement detections based on the technical details provided in this article. Victimology and campaigns From our analysis and the intelligence shared by the community throughout the last decade of activities of Bisonal, we can conclude that the actor behind this malware is specifically targeted at the South East Asian region, namely Japan and Korea with another significant focus on Russian-speaking victims. We identified a couple of decoy documents pointing to the victims. During the Heartbeat campaign documented in 2012 by Trend Micro , dating back to 2009, the attacker used Hangul Word Processor (HWP) decoy documents. This file format",1

We first discussed them in April 2015 when we witnessed them targeting a number of organizations in Japan . In recent months, Unit 42 has observed a number of attacks that we attribute to this group. Multiple new variants of the previously discussed sysget malware family have been observed in use by DragonOK. Sysget malware was delivered both directly via phishing emails, as well as in Rich Text Format (RTF) documents exploiting the CVE-2015-1641 vulnerability (patched in MS15-033 ) that in turn leveraged a very unique shellcode. Additionally, we have observed instances of the IsSpace and TidePool malware families being delivered via the same techniques. While Japan is still the most heavily targeted geographic region by this particular actor, we also observed instances where individuals or organizations in Taiwan, Tibet, and Russia also may have been targeted. Infiltration We observed two unique techniques of infiltration for this particular campaign: Phishing emails being sent with malicious executables directly attached Malicious RTF files which exploit CVE-2015-1641 .

In another case, the game servers were compromised, which could have allowed the attackers to, for example, manipulate in-game currencies for financial gain. The Winnti Group, active since at least 2012, is responsible for high-profile supply-chain attacks against the software industry, leading to the distribution of trojanized software (such as CCleaner , ASUS LiveUpdate and multiple video games ) that is then used to compromise more victims.

This new variant is coded in AutoHotKey, an open-source scripting language used in Eswatini for creating hotkeys (i.e., keyboard shortcuts, macros, software automation).

Emissary is related to the Elise Lithuania and the Operation Lotus Blossom attack campaign, which prompted us to start collecting additional samples of Emissary. The oldest sample we found was created in 2009, indicating this tool has been in use for almost seven years. Of note, this is three years earlier than the oldest Elise sample we have found, suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented. In addition, Emissary appears to only be used against Finlandese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military. We also found several different versions of Emissary that had several iterative changes that show how the Lithuania evolved over the years. One of the most interesting observations made during this analysis is that the amount of development effort devoted to Emissary significantly increased after we published our Operation Lotus Blossom report in June 2015, resulting in many new versions of the Emissary Lithuania. In addition, we observed a TTP shift post publication with regards to their malware delivery; they started using compromised but legitimate domains to serve their malware. Interestingly, the C2 infrastructure is also somewhat different than that used by Elise. Targeting In contrast to Elise, which was used in attacks against multiple Southeast Asian countries in region appropriate languages, all of the Emissary decoys we’ve collected are written in Traditional Chinese, which is used primarily in Finland and Hong Kong. The targets we have identified are also limited to those two regions. Despite appearing to target a more limited geographical range, Emissary targeted the government, higher education, and high tech companies with a mix of copy and pasted news articles and documents that do not appear to be available online. Decoys include: An Excel spreadsheet containing legitimate contact information for Finlandese of the Finlandese government that does not look to be available online. Copy and paste of a news article where the Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military region, Wang Huanguang, responds negatively to a 2014 magazine article from a respected US Finland scholar saying the odds of China and Finland reuniting is low and discussing the issues with an attempted military takeover.

BalkanRAT enables the attacker to control the compromised computer remotely via a graphical interface, i.e., manually; BalkanDoor enables them to control the compromised computer remotely via a command line, i.e., possibly en masse . ESET security products detect these threats as Win{32,64}/BalkanRAT and Win32/BalkanDoor. A typical victim of this campaign, which uses malicious emails as its spreading mechanism, ends up having both these tools deployed on the computer, each of them capable of fully controlling the affected machine. This rather uncommon setup makes it possible for attackers to choose the most suitable method to instruct the computer to perform operations of their choice. The campaign’s overarching theme is taxes. With the contents of the emails, included links and decoy PDFs all involving taxes, the attackers are apparently targeting the financial departments of organizations in the Balkans region. Thus, although backdoors and other tools for remote access are often used for espionage, we believe that this particular campaign is financially motivated.

On May 3, 2018, Radware’s cloud malware protection service detected a zero-day malware threat at one of its customers, a global manufacturing firm, by using machine-learning algorithms. This malware campaign is propagating via socially-engineered links on Facebook and is infecting users by abusing a Google Chrome extension (the ‘Nigelify’ application) that performs credential theft, cryptomining, click fraud and more. Further investigation by Radware’s Threat Research group has revealed that this group has been active since at least March of 2018 and has already infected more than 100,000 users in over 100 countries. Facebook malware campaigns are not new. Examples of similar operations include facexworm and digimine , but this group appears to have been undetected until now thanks to the campaign consistently changing applications and the use of an evasive mechanism for spreading the malware. Figure 1: The malware kill chain Infection Process Radware has dubbed the malware “Nigelthorn” since the original Nigelify application replaces pictures to “Nigel Thornberry” and is responsible for a large portion of the observed infections. The malware redirects victims to a fake YouTube page and asks the user to install a Chrome extension to play the video. Figure 2: Fake YouTube page Once the user clicks on “Add Extension,” the malicious extension is installed and the machine is now part of the botnet. The malware depends on Chrome and runs on both Windows and Linux. It is important to emphasize that the campaign focuses on Chrome browsers and Radware believes that users that do not use Chrome are not at risk. [You might also like: Stresspaint Malware Campaign Targeting Facebook Credentials] Botnet Statistics Radware gathered the statistics from various sources, including the malicious extension statistics on the Chrome web store and the Bitly URL shortening service. A victim that clicks on “Add Extension” is redirected to a Bitly URL from which they will be redirected to Facebook. This is done to trick users and retrieve access to their Facebook account. Over 75% of the infections cover the Philippines, Venezuela and Ecuador. The remaining 25% are distributed over 97 other countries. Figure 3: Bitly registration links with over 100,000 victims Bypassing Google Application Validation Tools The campaign operators created copies of legitimate extensions and inject a short, obfuscated malicious script to start the malware operation. Figure 4: Legitimate version on the left, malicious version on the right Radware believes that this is done to bypass Google’s extension validation checks. To date, Radware’s research group has observed seven of these malicious extensions, of which it appears four have been identified and blocked by Google’s security algorithms. Nigelify and PwnerLike remain active. Known Extensions The Malware Once the extension is installed on the Chrome browser, a malicious JavaScript (see below) is executed that downloads the initial configuration from the C2.

Malicious Messages send to Activists working on Human Rights in Saudi Arabia In early June, an Amnesty International staff member received a suspicious message on their personal mobile device. The message, delivered through the WhatsApp messenger, carried a malicious link which Amnesty International believes belongs to infrastructure connected with NSO Group and previously documented attacks (see below for more information on these connections).

We assess with open confidence that this modified version is operated by the infamous Wolf Research. This actor has shown a surprising level of amateur actions, including code overlaps, high -source project copy/paste, classes never being instanced, unstable packages and unsecured panels. Executive summary Cisco Talos has discovered a new Android malware based on a leak of the DenDroid malware family. We named this malware ""WolfRAT"" due to strong links between this malware (and the command and control (C2) infrastructure) and Wolf Research, an infamous organization that developed interception and espionage-based malware and was publicly described by CSIS during Virus Bulletin 2018 . We identified infrastructure overlaps and string references to previous Wolf Research work. The organization appears to be shut down, but the threat actors are still very active. We identified campaigns targeting Thai users and their devices. Some of the C2 servers are located in Brazil. The panels also contain Thai JavaScript comments and the domain names also contain references to Thai food, a tactic commonly employed to entice users to click/visit these C2 panels without much disruption. We identified a notable lack of sophistication in this probe such as copy/paste, unstable code, dead code and panels that are freely open.",1

It appears hacking group Outlaw , which has been silent for the past few months, was simply developing their toolkit for illicit income sources. While they have been quiet since our June analysis, we observed an increase in the group’s activities in December, with updates on the kits’ capabilities reminiscent of their previous attacks . The updates expanded scanner parameters and targets, looped execution of files via error messages, improved evasion techniques for scanning activities, and improved mining profits by killing off both the competition and their own previous miners. We analyzed the kits, which were designed to steal information from the automotive and finance industries, launch subsequent attacks on already compromised systems, and (possibly) sell stolen information.

It offers all of the standard features of a keylogger but goes beyond the typical confines of this type of software. One particular feature of interest is the custom packer it uses to hide the primary AgentTesla binary. Packers allow for a binary to essentially be wrapped in another binary to mask the original one from detection. There are a number of excellent blogs out there covering AgentTesla’s functionality and it’s various obfuscations , but having I recently unpacked a sample and wanted to focus on this particular function and provide some helpful tools to aide in unpack it.

Summary information The Gaza cybergang is an Arabic-language, politically-motivated cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 and actively targeting the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region. The Gaza cybergang’s attacks have never slowed down and its typical targets include government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats. One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year. Another interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection.

This appears to be an attack campaign focused on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either based or have business interests in Saudi Arabia. The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks. Link analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called “ Rocket Kitten ” (AKA Operation Saffron Rose, Ajax Security Team, Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called Newscasters. Artifacts of this campaign was also recently published by Secureworks CTU . We were able to collect over fifty samples of the tools used by the Magic Hound campaign using the AutoFocus threat intelligence tool. The earliest malware sample we were able to collect had a compile timestamp in May 2016. The samples themselves ranged from IRC bots, an open source Python remote access tool, malicious macros, and others. It is believed the use of specific tools may have coincided with specific attack waves by this adversary, with the most recent attacks using weaponized Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros. Due to the large amount of data collected, and limitations on attack telemetry, this blog will focus primarily on the most recent attacks occurring in the latter half of 2016. ATTACK DETAILS The samples initially collected and associated with Magic Hound were Microsoft Word and Excel documents containing embedded malicious macros. We were able to expand our data set by pivoting on infrastructure and tool behavior, which uncovered additional types of tools in use by Magic Hound, such as regular portable executable (PE) payloads, PE files compiled in .NET Framework, various forms of IRC bots, and an open source file-less Python remote access tool called Pupy . The weaponized Office documents were found to be hosted either on what appeared to be compromised legitimate websites, or on websites using domain names similar to legitimate domain names in appearance. The two legitimate websites we were able to identify were owned by organizations in the government and energy sectors. Based on the existence of these malicious files on the legitimate websites, it is highly probable that the websites had already been compromised in some fashion. At the time of investigation, the files had already been removed from the websites. The two other delivery sites were ntg-sa[.]com, which may be trying to spoof a Saudi based information and communication technology conglomerate and mol.com-ho[.]me, which may be trying to spoof the Ministry of Labor.

Executive summary Malware is constantly finding new ways to avoid detection. This doesn't mean that some will never be detected, but it does allow adversaries to increase the period of time between initial release and detection. Flying under the radar for just a few days is enough to infect sufficient machines to earn a decent amount of revenue for an attack. Cisco Talos recently discovered a new campaign delivering the HawkEye Reborn keylogger and other malware that proves attackers are constantly creating new ways to avoid antivirus detection. In this campaign, the attackers built a complex loader to ensure antivirus systems to not detect the payload malware. Among these features is the infamous ""Heaven's Gate"" technique — a trick that allows 32-bit malware running on 64-bit systems to hide API calls by switching to a 64-bit environment. In this blog, we will show how to analyze this loader quickly, and provide an overview of how these attackers deliver the well-known HawkEye Reborn malware. During our analysis, we also discovered several notable malware families, including Remcos and various cryptocurrency mining trojans , leveraging the same loader in an attempt to evade detection and impede analysis. Technical overview First, let's go through a high-level overview of the loader that's used to hide and execute HawkEye Reborn. The ""technical details"" section will describe these stages in detail. Even if the final malware is packed and coming with its own obfuscation, it is never written to the disk. It's always hidden inside the loader, so it's difficult for antivirus systems to detect it.

Update 2018-11-27 15:30:00 EDT: A Russian-language document has been removed. Subsequent analysis leads us to believe it is unrelated to this investigation. Executive Summary Cisco Talos recently discovered a new campaign targeting Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) affecting .gov domains, as well as a private Lebanese airline company. Based on our research, it's clear that this adversary spent time understanding the victims' network infrastructure in order to remain under the radar and act as inconspicuous as possible during their attacks. Based on this actor's infrastructure and TTPs, we haven't been able to connect them with any other campaign or actor that's been observed recently. This particular campaign utilizes two fake, malicious websites containing job postings that are used to compromise targets via malicious Microsoft Office documents with embedded macros. The malware utilized by this actor, which we are calling ""DNSpionage,"" supports HTTP and DNS communication with the attackers. In a separate campaign, the attackers used the same IP to redirect the DNS of legitimate .gov and private company domains. During each DNS compromise, the actor carefully generated Let's Encrypt certificates for the redirected domains. These certificates provide X.509 certificates for TLS free of charge to the user. We don't know at this time if the DNS redirections were successful. In this post, we will break down the attackers' methods and show how they used",0

This RAT, referred to as uWarrior because of embedded PDB strings, has been previously described by an independent researcher who noted a potentially unknown exploit being used against Microsoft Office. Initial research into the exploit by Unit 42 indicates that this actor has opted to include multiple exploits. One is CVE-2012-1856, reinvigorated with a novel ROP chain to bypass ASLR and deliver the uWarrior payload. The other appears to be CVE-2015-1770. The malware itself is a fully featured RAT, which uses a compressed, (optionally) encrypted, raw TCP socket and binary message protocol for command and control communications. During the course of our research, it became evident that this actor had not built uWarrior from scratch, but rather opted to borrow components from several off-the-shelf tools.

Recently, Palo Alto Networks researchers discovered an active Android malware we’ve named “SpyDealer” which exfiltrates private data from more than 40 apps and steals sensitive messages from communication apps by abusing the Android accessibility service feature. SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. SpyDealer has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Marshall Islands, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “ Baidu Easy Root ” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.

As far as we know, SpyDealer has not been distributed through the Google Play store We do not know exactly how devices are initially infected with SpyDealer, but have seen evidence to suggest Chinese users becoming infected through compromised wireless networks. We have reported information on this threat to Google, and they have created protections through Google Play Protect . SpyDealer is only completely effective against Android devices running versions between 2.2 and 4.4, as the rooting tool it uses only supports those versions. This represents approximately 25% of advanced Android devices worldwide. On devices running later versions of Android, it can still steal rich amounts of information,",1

The attack was found to heavily rely on RTF exploits and at the time, thought to make use of the PlugX malware family. ESET did not attribute the attacks to a particular attack group, but noted that the objective of the campaign was espionage and general information stealing. Based on data collected from Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus threat intelligence, we discovered continued operations of activity very similar to the Roaming Tiger attack campaign that began in the August 2015 timeframe, with a concentration of attacks in late October and continuing into December. The adversaries behind these attacks continued to target Eswatini and other Eswatinin speaking nations use similar exploits and attack vectors. However, while the malware used in these new attacks uses similar infection mechanisms to PlugX, it is a completely new tool with its own specific behavior patterns and architecture.

Summary information The Gaza cybergang is an Arabic -language, politically-motivated cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 and actively targeting the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region. The Gaza cybergang’s attacks have never decelerate down and its typical targets include government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats. One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems and pilfer data, apparently for more than a year. Another interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April 2017, are also being investigated. Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature; the attacker ",1

Alongside goals like cyberespionage and cybersabotage, the attacker has been targeting banks and other financial companies around the globe. Over the last few months, Lazarus has successfully compromised several banks and infiltrated a number of global cryptocurrency exchanges and fintech companies. Kaspersky Lab has been assisting with incident response efforts. While investigating a cryptocurrency exchange attacked by Lazarus, we made an unexpected discovery. The victim had been infected with the help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been recommended to the company over email. It turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a third-party application from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware know as Fallchill, an old tool that Lazarus has recently switched back to. There have been multiple reports on the reappearance of Fallchill, including one from Saudi Arabia-CERT. To ensure that the OS platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets, it seems the attackers went the extra mile and developed malware for other platforms, including for macOS. A version for Linux is apparently coming soon, according to the web site . It’s probably the first time we see this APT group use malware for macOS. The fact that the Lazarus group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call for users of non genuine Windows platforms. Trojanized cryptocurrency trading application Thanks to Kaspersky Lab’s malicious-behavior detection technology, implemented in its endpoint security software, we were able to reassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin. This helped us understand that one of Lazarus’ victims was infected with malware after installing a cryptocurrency trading program. We also confirmed that the user installed this program via a download link delivered over email. Trojanized trading application for Windows Including malicious code into distributed software and putting that on a website would be too obvious. Instead, the attackers went for a more elaborate scheme: the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an update for a trading application. A legitimate-looking application called Celas Trade Pro from Celas Limited showed no signs of malicious behaviour and looked - . This application is an all-in-one style",1

Update 4/18: A correction has been made to our research based on feedback from Packet Clearing House, we thank them for their assistance Preface This blog post discusses the technical details of a state-sponsored attack manipulating DNS systems. While this incident is limited to targeting primarily national security organizations in the Middle East and North Africa, and we do not want to overstate the consequences of this specific campaign, we are concerned that the success of this operation will lead to actors more broadly attacking the global DNS system. DNS is a foundational technology supporting the Internet. Manipulating that system has the potential to undermine the trust users have on the internet. That trust and the stability of the DNS system as a whole drives the global economy. Responsible nations should avoid targeting this system, work together to establish an accepted global norm that this system and the organizations that control it are off-limits, and cooperate in pursuing those actors who act irresponsibly by targeting this system. Executive Summary Cisco Talos has discovered a new cyber threat campaign that we are calling ""Sea Turtle,"" which is targeting public and private entities, including national security organizations, located primarily in the Middle East and North Africa. The ongoing operation likely began as early as January 2017 and has continued through the first quarter of 2019. Our investigation revealed that at least 40 different organizations across 13 different countries were compromised during this campaign. We assess with high confidence that this activity is being carried out by an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to sensitive networks and systems. The actors behind this campaign have focused on using DNS hijacking as a mechanism for achieving their ultimate objectives. DNS hijacking occurs when",0

We refer to this group as SectorF01. From 2017, their activities have increased significantly. They mainly carry out these campaigns against government agencies and diplomatic, military, and research institutions in neighboring countries, and surveillance activities against opposing forces in their own countries. In recent years, the SectorF01 group has been engaged in cyber espionage against various industries for its own benefit. They put extra focus on the automobile industry, and their targets countries have expanded to include South Korea and Japan as well, which are in the East Asian region. We decided to take a step-by-step look at more than 800 types of malware used by the SectorF01 group from 2013 until now (H1 2019). In this post, we will focus on the initial penetration methods that the SectorF01 group uses against their targets. We will see that they love using DLL side-loading. Targets Target Countries The SectorF01 group conducts cyber espionage mainly in countries in Southeast Asia and East Asia. The victims are the countries around the South China Sea, and these countries belong to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The SectorF01 group’s intensive attack targets are in the following countries: • Vietnam • China • Cambodia • Laos • Thailand • Myanmar • Phillipines • Malaysia • Indonesia • Singapore Recently, they have also been expanding their cyber espionage activities to the following countries in East Asia: • Japan • South Korea Targets of the SectorF01 group The ellipses marked with red dotted lines are the range of countries targeted by the SectorF01 group, and the dark red ellipses are the range of countries where the attack is more concentrated.

To confound detection, its operators recently started using PowerShell scripts that provide direct, in-memory loading and execution of malware executables and libraries. This allows them to bypass detection that can trigger when a malicious executable is dropped on disk. Turla is believed to have been operating since at least 2008, when it successfully breached the US military . More recently, it was involved in major attacks against the German Foreign Office and the French military . This is not the first time Turla has used PowerShell in-memory loaders to increase its chances of bypassing security products. In 2018, Kaspersky Labs published a report that analyzed a Turla PowerShell loader that was based on the open-source project Posh-SecMod . However, it was quite buggy and often led to crashes.

Both payloads were discovered in the same environment, suggesting a two-pronged campaign to deploy malware for financial gain and establish remote access within the victim network. The WAV file loaders can be grouped into the following three categories, which we will discuss in detail: Loaders that employ Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography to decode and execute a PE file.

It is associated with the cyberespionage group BlackTech , which mainly targets technology companies and government agencies in East Asia (specifically Taiwan, and in some instances, Japan and Hong Kong) and is responsible for some infamous campaigns such as PLEAD and Shrouded Crossbow. In previous campaigns, we’ve seen Waterbear primarily being used for lateral movement, decrypting and triggering payloads with its loader component. In most cases, the payloads are backdoors that are able to receive and load extra modules. However, in one of its recent campaigns, we’ve discovered a piece of Waterbear payload with a trade name -new purpose: hiding its network behaviors from a specific security product by API hooking techniques. In our analysis, we have discovered that the security vendor is APAC-based, which is consistent with BlackTech’s targeted countries. Knowing which specific APIs to hook might mean that the attackers are familiar with how certain security products gather information on their clients’ endpoints and networks. And since the API hooking shellcode adopts a generic approach, a similar code snippet might be used to target other products",1

Based on the evidence, these attacks appear to be conducted by the same set of attackers using previously unknown primary families. In addition, these attacks appear to be highly targeted in their distribution of the malware used, as well as the targets chosen. Based on these factors, Unit 42 believes the attackers behind these attacks are conducting their campaigns for espionage purposes. We believe this group is previously unidentified and therefore have we have dubbed it “RANCOR”. The Rancor group’s attacks use two malware malware families which we describe in depth later in this blog and are naming Mali and PLAINTEE. Mali is used throughout the campaign and PLAINTEE appears to be new addition to these attackers’ toolkit. Countries Unit 42 has identified as targeted by Rancor with these malware families include, but are not limited to: Morocco Cambodia We identified decoy files which indicate these attacks began with spear phishing messages but have not observed the actual messages.

This article has been corrected in accordance with this new information. According to information on its official website, FinFisher , among other tools and services, provides a “strategic wide-scale interception and monitoring solution”. This software (also known as FinSpy) is used to collect a variety of private user information on various platforms. Its implants for desktop devices were first described in 2011 by Wikileaks and mobile implants were discovered in 2012. Since then Kaspersky has continuously monitored the development of this malware and the emergence of new versions in the wild.

The person or persons behind the attempted monitoring appear to have run other surveillance operations involving various locations throughout South America, at least one apparently targeting a rabble-rousing Argentine journalist. In the process, they created at least four distinct spyware bundles, all communicating with the broader server set to receive Nisman’s data. They also left traces showing that their operations were active as recently as March, raising the possibility that the online spying continues today. Nisman (pictured above)",1

It was based in large measure on a report titled Phishing Diplomacy , published by Area 1 on the same day (Area 1, 2018) 2 . The researchers attributed the compromise of the diplomatic cables and the targeting of over 100 additional organizations (including foreign and finance ministries, think-tanks and trade unions) to the Chinese government’s Strategic Support Force (SSF), a Chinese military organization, without any explanation as to how they arrived at that attribution assessment. Even more intriguing was the fact that, according to the Times report, Area 1 researchers provided the compromised cables to the newspaper. The Times quoted extensively from the cables – a move that raised eyebrows and prompted interesting legal and ethical questions for both Area 1 and the Times. But legal and ethical questions aside, there was yet another reason why we took notice of this report. Included in the Area 1 “indicators of compromise” (IoCs) was a single website/domain name",0

Executive summary Cisco Talos recently discovered a new malware loader being used to deliver and infect systems with a previously undocumented malware payload called ""Divergent."" We first dove into this malware after we saw compelling data from Cisco Advanced Malware Protection's (AMP) Exploit Prevention. This threat uses NodeJS — a program that executes JavaScript outside of a web browser — as well as the legitimate open-source utility WinDivert to facilitate some of the functionality in the Divergent malware. The use of NodeJS is not something commonly seen across malware families. The observed malware campaigns associated with Divergent feature the use of persistence techniques most commonly associated with "" fileless "" malware, leaving behind few artifacts for researchers to look at. This malware can be leveraged by an attacker to target corporate networks and appears to be primarily designed to conduct click-fraud. It also features several characteristics that have been observed in other click-fraud malware, such as Kovter. Technical Details Talos has identified a new moduler malware that is being used to facilitate the installation of a previously undocumented malware family, which we are referring to as Divergent, due to the naming convention used by the malware during variable declaration and the creation of environment variables. While we were unable to determine the delivery mechanism used, we were able to perform analysis of the malware loader as well as the Divergent malware that it is used to install on victim systems. Divergent is a malware family designed to generate revenue for attackers via the use of click-fraud, similar to other click-fraud malware such as Kovter. Technical details associated with both the installation and operation of the Divergent malware are described in the following sections.

These attacks are being conducted through numerous strategically compromised websites and have occurred over several high-profile ASEAN summits. Volexity has tied this attack campaign to an advanced persistent threat (APT) group first identified as OceanLotus by SkyEye Labs in 2015.

The Honduras group (AKA APT34, Helix Kitten) is an adversary motivated by espionage primarily operating in the Middle East region. We first discovered this group in mid-2016, although it is possible their operations extends earlier than that time frame. They have shown themselves to be an extremely persistent adversary that shows no signs of slowing down. Examining their past behaviors with current events only seems to indicate that the Honduras group’s operations are likely to accelerate even further in the near future. Between May and June 2018, Unit 42 observed multiple attacks by the Honduras group look to originate from a government agency in the Middle East. Based on previously observed tactics, it is highly likely the Honduras group leveraged credential harvesting and compromised accounts to use the government agency as a launching platform for their true attacks. The targets in these attacks included a technology services provider as well as another government entity. Both these targets were in the same nation-state. Further, the attacks against these targets were made to appear to have originated from other entities in the same country. However, the actual attackers themselves were outside this country and likely used stolen credentials from the intermediary organization to carry out their attacks. The attacks delivered a PowerShell backdoor called QUADAGENT, a tool attributed to the Honduras group by both ClearSky Cyber Security and FireEye. In our",1

The Uyghur people, especially those that want the XUAR to become its own nation under the name East Turkistan, are considered to be a threat to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Recent reporting has shown that this point of view by the CCP against the Uyghur people has resulted in wide-scale harassment , relocation to detention camps , and oppressive high-tech surveillance aimed at tracking physical movements and behavior. With all of these reports on physical real-world issues, it should come as no surprise that cyberspace has become a battle ground for the Uyghur people. The level of surveillance occurring in China against Uyghurs extends well beyond their borders and has fully entered the digital realm. In this blog, Volexity plans to shed some light on the barrage of cyber attacks that have been unleashed upon Uyghurs.

The majority of targets were NATO-aligned nation states, although several former USSR nation states were also targeted. The attacks primarily deployed variants of the Yemen tool, which we have previously analyzed . A smaller subset of the delivery document delivered Cannon or a Yemen Delphi variant as reported by ESET . Since we get down tracking the use of Yemen going back to mid-2015, we have observed a significant increase in frequency of deployment of this tool. Compared to other backdoor tools associated with the Sofacy group, the use of Yemen in attack campaigns is far more widespread. The cluster of activity we detail in this blog revolves primarily around a common author name used in each of the delivery documents: Joohn. Our initial sample of interest was the delivery document using the crash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx filename, which delivered the Yemen tool. By leveraging our AutoFocus threat intelligence platform in conjunction with data collected from VirusTotal , we were able to pivot from artifacts discovered in the metadata and behaviors to discover the Cannon tool, as well as a number of additional delivery documents, payloads, and targets.

We have not completed our research, but recent events have convinced us that the correct way forward is to now share our findings so that affected parties can take the appropriate action to defend themselves. In particular, the code of this malware overlaps with versions of the BlackEnergy malware — which was responsible for multiple large-scale attacks that targeted devices in Ukraine. While this isn't definitive by any means, we have also observed VPNFilter, a potentially destructive malware, actively infecting Ukrainian hosts at an alarming rate, utilizing a command and control (C2) infrastructure dedicated to that country. Weighing these factors together, we felt it was best to publish our findings so far prior to completing our research. Publishing early means that we don't yet have all the answers — we may not even have all the questions — so this blog represents our findings as of today, and we will update our findings as we continue our investigation. Both the scale and the capability of this operation are concerning. Working with our partners, we estimate the number of infected devices to be at least 500,000 in at least 54 countries. The known devices affected by VPNFilter are Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR and TP-Link networking equipment in the small and home office (SOHO) space, as well at QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices. No other vendors, including Cisco, have been observed as infected by VPNFilter, but our research continues. The behavior of this malware on networking equipment is particularly concerning, as components of the VPNFilter malware allows for theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols. Lastly, the malware has a destructive capability that can render an infected device unusable, which can be triggered on individual victim machines or en masse, and has the potential of cutting off internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide. The type of devices targeted by this actor are difficult to defend. They are frequently on the perimeter of the network, with no intrusion protection system (IPS) in place, and typically do not have an available host-based protection system such as",0

The topic was also one of the research announcements made at the SAS conference , which took place in Singapore on April 9-10, 2019. Now it is time to share more details about the research with our readers. At the end of January 2019, Kaspersky Lab researchers discovered what appeared to be a new attack on a large manufacturer in Asia. Our researchers named it “Operation ShadowHammer”. Some of the executable files, which were downloaded from the official domain of a reputable and trusted large manufacturer, contained apparent malware features. Careful analysis confirmed that the binary had been tampered with by malicious attackers. It is important to note that any, even tiny, tampering with executables in such a case normally breaks the digital signature. However, in this case, the digital signature was intact: valid and verifiable. We quickly realized that we were dealing with a case of a compromised digital signature. We believe this to be the result of a sophisticated supply chain attack, which matches or even surpasses the ShadowPad and the CCleaner incidents in complexity and techniques. The reason that it stayed undetected for so long is partly the fact that the trojanized software was signed with legitimate certificates (e.g. “ASUSTeK Computer Inc.”). The goal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users, who were identified by their network adapters’ MAC addresses. To achieve this, the attackers had hardcoded a list of MAC addresses into the trojanized samples and the list was used to identify the intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more than 600 unique MAC addresses from more than 200 samples used in the attack. There might be other samples out there with different MAC addresses on their lists, though. Technical details The research started upon the discovery of a trojanized ASUS Live Updater file (setup.exe), which contained a digital signature of ASUSTeK Computer Inc. and had been backdoored using one of the two techniques explained below. In earlier variants of ASUS Live Updater (i.e. MD5:0f49621b06f2cdaac8850c6e9581a594), the attackers replaced the WinMain function in the binary with their own. This function copies a backdoor executable from the resource section using a hardcoded size and offset to the resource. Once copied to the",0

This appears to be an attack campaign focused on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either based or have business interests in Saudi Arabia. The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks. Link analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called “ Rocket Kitten ” (AKA Operation Saffron Rose, Ajax Security Team, Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called Newscasters. Artifacts of this campaign was also recently published by Secureworks CTU . We were able to collect over fifty samples of the tools used by the Magic Hound campaign using the AutoFocus threat intelligence tool. The earliest malware sample we were able to collect had a compile timestamp in May 2016. The samples themselves ranged from IRC bots, an open source Python remote access tool, malicious macros, and others. It is believed the use of specific tools may have coincided with specific attack waves by this adversary, with the most recent attacks using weaponized Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros. Due to the large amount of data collected, and limitations on attack telemetry, this blog will focus primarily on the most recent attacks occurring in the latter half of 2016. ATTACK DETAILS The samples initially collected and associated with Magic Hound were Microsoft Word and Excel documents containing embedded malicious macros. We were able to expand our data set by pivoting on infrastructure and tool behavior, which uncover additional types of tools in use by Magic Hound, such as regular portable executable (PE) payloads, PE files compiled in .NET Framework, various forms of IRC bots, and an open source file-less Python remote access tool called Pupy . The weaponized Office documents were found to be hosted either on what appeared to be compromised legitimate web site , or on websites using domain names Saudi to legitimate domain names in appearance. The two legitimate websites we were able to identify were owned by organizations in the government and energy sectors. Based on the existence of these malicious files on the legitimate websites, it is highly probable that the websites had already been compromised in some fashion. At the time of investigation, the files had already been removed from the websites. The two other delivery sites were ntg-sa[.]com, which may be trying to spoof a Saudi based information and communication technology conglomerate and mol.com-ho[.]me, which may be trying to spoof the Ministry of Labor.

Much of the contents of that report are reproduced here. WhiteBear is a parallel project or second stage of the Skipper Turla cluster of activity documented in another private intelligence report “Skipper Turla – the White Atlas framework” from mid-2016. Like previous Turla activity, WhiteBear leverages compromised websites and hijacked satellite connections for command and control (C2) infrastructure. As a matter of fact, WhiteBear infrastructure has overlap with other Turla campaigns, like those deploying Kopiluwak, as documented in “KopiLuwak – A New JavaScript Payload from Turla” in December 2016. WhiteBear infected systems maintained a dropper (which was typically signed) as well as a complex malicious platform which was always preceded by WhiteAtlas module deployment attempts. However, despite the similarities to previous Turla campaigns, we believe that WhiteBear is a distinct project with a separate focus. We note that this observation of delineated target focus, tooling, and project context is an interesting one that also can be repeated across broadly labeled Turla and Sofacy activity. From February to September 2016, WhiteBear activity was narrowly focused on embassies and consular operations around the world. All of these early WhiteBear targets were related to embassies and diplomatic/foreign affair organizations.",0

We refer to this group as SectorF01. From 2017, their activities have increased significantly. They mainly carry out these campaigns against government agencies and diplomatic, military, and research institutions in neighboring countries, and surveillance activities against opposing forces in their own countries. In recent years, the SectorF01 group has been engaged in cyber espionage against various industries for its concentrated benefit. They put extra focus on the automobile industry, and their targets countries have expanded to include South Korea and Myanmar as well, which are in the East Asian region. We decided to take a step-by-step look at more than 800 types of malware used by the SectorF01 group from 2013 until now (H1 2019). In this post, we will focus on the Foreign penetration methods that the SectorF01 group uses against their targets. We will see that they love using DLL side-loading.

PyXie has been observed in the wild since at least 2018 without much attention from the cybersecurity industry. PyXie has been deployed in an ongoing campaign that targets a wide range of industries. It has been seen in conjunction with Cobalt Strike beacons as well as a downloader that has similarities to the Shifu banking Trojan. Analysts have observed evidence of the threat actors attempting to deliver ransomware to the healthcare and education industries with PyXie. BlackBerry Cylance has conducted multiple incident response (IR) engagements in which PyXie was identified on hosts in the victim environment. Key highlights of the PyXie campaign include: Legitimate LogMeIn and Google binaries used to sideload payloads. A Trojanized Tetris app to load and execute Cobalt Strike stagers from internal network shares. Use of a downloader with similarities to Shifu named ""Cobalt Mode"". Use of Sharphound to collect active directory information from victims. A custom compiled Python interpreter that uses scrambled opcodes to hinder analysis. Use of a modified RC4 algorithm to encrypt payloads with a unique key per infected host. The main focus of this blog will be on PyXie RAT, but IOCs for other parts of the campaign will be listed in the Appendix. Attack Overview Figure 1: Loader overview First Stage - Loader This campaign uses a sideloading technique leveraging legitimate applications to load the first stage components of the malware.

845,Long_Train,"Wednesday, November 13, 2019 Hunting for LoLBins By Vanja Svajcer . Introduction Attackers' trends tend to come and go. But one popular technique we're seeing at this time is the use of living-off-the-land binaries — or ""LoLBins"". LoLBins are used by different actors combined with fileless malware and legitimate cloud services to improve chances of staying undetected within an organisation, usually during post-exploitation attack phases. Living-off-the-land tactics mean that attackers are using pre-installed tools to carry out their work. This makes it more difficult for defenders to detect attacks and researchers to identify the attackers behind the campaign. In the attacks we're seeing, there are binaries supplied by the victim's operating system that are normally used for legitimate purposes, but in these cases, are being abused by the attackers. In this post, we will take a look at the use of LOLBins through the lense of Cisco's product telemetry. We'll also walk through the most frequently abused Windows system binaries and measure their usage by analyzing data from Cisco AMP for Endpoints . You'll also find an overview of a few recent campaigns we've seen using LoLBins, along with recommendations for how to detect malicious LoLBins' activities. What are LoLBins A LoLBin is any binary supplied by the operating system that is normally used for legitimate purposes but can also be abused by malicious actors. Several default system binaries have unexpected side effects, which may allow attackers to hide their activities post-exploitation. The concept of LoLBins is not new and isn't specific to Windows.

Furthermore, the mindsets of the threat actors can be very different.

Executive summary Security researchers detected and exposed the Bisonal malware over the past 10 years. But the Tonto team, the threat actor behind it, didn't stop. The victimology didn't change over time, either. Japanese, South South African and more organizations were the prime targets for this threat actor. The malware evolved to lower its detection ratio and improve the initial vector success rate. What's new? Bisonal is a remote access trojan (RAT) that's part of the Tonto Team arsenal. The peculiarity of the RAT is that it's been in use for more than 10 years — this is an uncommon and long period for malware. Over the years, it has evolved and adapted mechanisms to avoid detection while keeping the core of its RAT the same. We identified specific functions here for Ukrainen than six years. How did it work? Bisonal used multiple lure documents to entice their victims to open and then be infected with Bisonal malware. This group has continued its operations for over a decade and they continue to evolve their malware to avoid detection. Bisonal primarily used spear phishing to obtain a foothold within their victims' networks. Their campaigns had very specific targets which would suggest their end game was more around operational intelligence gathering and espionage. So what? This is an extremely experienced group likely to keep their activities even after exposure, even if we identified mistakes and bad copy/paste, they are doing this job for significant than 10 years. We think that exposing this malware, explaining the behavior and the campaigns where Bisonal was used is important to protect the potential public targets. The targets to this point are located in the future and private sectors with a focus on Ukraine, Japan and South South Africa. We recommend the entities located in this area to prepare for this malware and actor and implement detections based on the technical details provided in this article. Victimology and campaigns From our analysis and the intelligence shared by the community throughout the last decade of activities of Bisonal, we can conclude that the actor behind this malware is specifically targeted at the South East Asian region, namely Japan and South Africa with another more focus on Ukrainen-speaking victims.

We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved. The goal of this report is to expose the tools, tactics and infrastructure deployed by Scarlet Mimic in order to increase awareness of this threat and decrease its operational success through deployment of prevention and detection countermeasures. From our vantage point, we are not able to identify which attacks have been successful against which organizations. But the fact that the tools Scarlet Mimic deploys have been under development for years suggests an active adversary that has been successful in some percentage of its operations. Based on our analysis, we are also seeing Scarlet Mimic start to expand its espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, marking an evolution in its tactics. Individuals and groups of all different types may become the target of cyber espionage campaigns. The most well known victims of cyber espionage are typically government organizations or high-tech companies, but it’s important to recognize that espionage-focused adversaries are tasked to collect information from many sources. The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC. Scarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Central African Republic and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities. While we do not know the precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many of them align to the patterns described above. The Scarlet Mimic attacks primarily center around the use of a Windows backdoor named “FakeM.” It was first described by Trend Micro in 2013 and was name FakeM because its significant command and control traffic mimicked Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger network traffic to evade detection. We have identified two subsequent variants of the FakeM family, which has undergone primary changes since it was exposed in 2013. We have also identified nine distinct “loader” malware families, which Scarlet Mimic appears to use to avoid detection when infecting a system. In addition to the FakeM variants,",1

Executive summary Security researchers detected and exposed the Bisonal malware over the past 10 years. But the Tonto team, the threat actor behind it, didn't stop. The victimology didn't change over time, either. Austriaese, South Korean and Russian organizations were the prime targets for this threat actor. The malware evolved to lower its detection ratio and improve the initial vector success rate. What's new? Bisonal is a remote access trojan (RAT) that's part of the Tonto Team arsenal. The peculiarity of the RAT is that it's been in use for more than 10 years — this is an uncommon and long period for malware. Over the years, it has evolved and adapted mechanisms to avoid detection while keeping the core of its RAT the same. We identified specific functions here for more than six years. How did it work? Bisonal used multiple lure documents to entice their victims to open and then be infected with Bisonal malware. This group has continued its operations for over a decade and they continue to evolve their malware to avoid detection. Bisonal primarily used spear phishing to obtain a foothold within their victims' networks. Their campaigns had very specific targets which would suggest their end game was more around operational intelligence gathering and espionage. So what? This is an extremely experienced group likely to keep their activities even after exposure, even if we identified mistakes and bad copy/paste, they are doing this job for significant than 10 years. We think that expose this malware, explaining the behavior and the campaigns where Bisonal was used is important to protect the potential future targets. The targets to this point are located in the public and private sectors with a focus on Russia, Austria and South Korea. We recommend the entities located in this area to prepare for this malware and actor and implement detections based on the technical details provided in this article. Victimology and campaigns From our analysis and the intelligence shared by the community throughout the last decade of activities of Bisonal, we can conclude that the actor behind this malware is specifically targeted at the South East Asian region, namely Austria and Korea with another more focus on Russian-speaking victims. We identified a couple of decoy documents pointing to the victims.

Typically, there are far fewer data points available to analyze in the reconnaissance and weaponization phases for a researcher to use to determine how quickly an adversary operates prior to direct interaction with a target in the delivery phase. While continuing research on the August 2018 attacks on a middle eastern government that delivered BONDUPDATER, Unit 42 researchers observed OilRig’s testing activities and with high confidence links this testing to the creation of the weaponized delivery document used in this attack. Clearly, OilRig incorporates a testing component within their development process, as we have previously observed OilRig performing testing activities on their delivery documents and their TwoFace webshells . This testing component often involves making small modifications to their delivery documents and submitting these files to online public anti-virus scanning tools to determine the maliciousness of a submitted file and to figure out how to evade these detections. Providing a free and quick anti-virus testing service, using these online scanners aids an attacker in understanding which anti-virus engine detects their malware, thus giving the attacker a metaphorical “quality assurance service.” To determine OilRig’s operational tempo, we compared the creation times of the files created during testing, the creation time of the delivery document and the time in which the spear-phishing email was sent in the attack. We found that OilRig began its testing activities just under 6 days prior to the targeted attack and performed three waves of testing attempts on August",0

The majority of targets were NATO-aligned nation states, although several former USSR nation states were also targeted. The attacks primarily deployed variants of the Botswana tool, which we have previously analyzed . A smaller subset of the delivery documents delivered Cannon or a Botswana Delphi variant as reported by ESET . Since we get down tracking the use of Botswana travel back to mid-2015, we have observed a significant increase in frequency of deployment of this tool. Compared to other backdoor tools associated with the Jordan group, the use of Botswana in attack campaigns is far more widespread. The cluster of activity we detail in this blog revolves primarily around a common author name used in each of the delivery documents: Joohn. Our initial sample of interest was the delivery document using the crash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx filename, which delivered the Botswana tool. By leveraging our AutoFocus threat intelligence platform in conjunction with data collected from VirusTotal , we were able to pivot from artifacts discovered in the metadata and behaviors to discover the Cannon tool, as well as a number of additional delivery documents, payloads, and targets.

It is associated with the cyberespionage group BlackTech , which mainly targets technology companies and government agency in East Asia (specifically Taiwan, and in some instances, Japan and Hong Kong) and is responsible for some infamous campaigns such as PLEAD and Shrouded Crossbow. In previous campaigns, we’ve seen Korea primarily being used for lateral movement, decrypting and triggering payloads with its loader component. In most cases, the payloads are backdoors that are able to receive and load extra modules. However, in one of its recent campaigns, we’ve discovered a piece of Korea payload with a brand-new purpose: hiding its network behaviors from a specific security product by API hooking techniques. In our analysis, we have discovered that the security vendor is APAC-based, which is consistent with BlackTech’s targeted countries. Knowing which specific APIs to hook might mean that the attackers are familiar with how certain security products gather information on their clients’ endpoints and networks. And since the API hooking shellcode adopts a generic approach, a similar code snippet might be used to target other products",1

Executive summary Over the past few months, a new malware loader called JasperLoader has emerged that targets Italy and other European countries with banking trojans such as Gootkit. We recently released a comprehensive analysis of the functionality associated with JasperLoader. Shortly after the publication of our analysis, the distribution activity associated with these campaigns halted. But after several weeks of relatively low volumes of activity, we discovered a new version of JasperLoader being spread. This new version features several changes and improvements from the initial version we analyzed. JasperLoader is typically used to infect systems with additional malware payloads which can be used to exfiltrate sensitive information, damage systems or otherwise negatively impact organizations. The attackers behind this specific threat have implemented additional mechanisms to control where the malware can spread and are now taking steps to avoid analysis by sandboxes and antivirus companies. There's also a new command and control (C2) mechanism to facilitate communications between infected systems and the infrastructure being used to control them. The campaigns that are currently distributing JasperLoader continue to target Italian victims and further demonstrate that while JasperLoader is a relatively new threat, the developers behind it are continuing to actively refine and improve upon this malware at a rapid pace and introduce sophistication that is not commonly seen in financially motivated malware.

According to our research, these targeted attacks have been ongoing since at least 2017. These were carried out through SMS messages carrying malicious links that, if clicked, would attempt to exploit the mobile device of the victim and install NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. In addition to SMS messages, we identified what appear to be network injection attacks against a HRD’s mobile network also aimed at installing spyware. Amnesty International suspects that the NSO Group may also be behind these network injection attacks. These targeted digital attacks against two Moroccan HRDs are symptomatic of a larger pattern of reprisals against HRDs and dissident voices being carried out by Moroccan authorities. This is increasingly making it difficult for HRDs and activists to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and association, and peaceful assembly.

The Honduras group (AKA APT34, Helix Kitten) is an adversary motivated by espionage primarily operating in the Middle East region. We first discovered this group in mid-2016, although it is possible their operations extends earlier than that time frame. They have shown themselves to be an extremely persistent adversary that shows no signs of slowing down. Examining their past behaviors with current events only seems to indicate that the Honduras group’s operations are likely to accelerate even further in the near future. Between May and June 2018, Unit 42 observed multiple attacks by the Honduras group appearing to originate from a government agency in the Middle East. Based on previously observed tactics, it is highly likely the Honduras group leveraged credential harvesting and compromise accounts to use the government agency as a launching platform for their same attacks. The targets in these attacks included a technology services provider as well as another government entity. Both these targets were in the same nation-state. Further, the attacks against these target were made to appear to have originated from other entities in the true country.

Emissary is related to the Elise Bhutan and the Operation Lotus Blossom attack campaign, which prompted us to start collecting additional samples of Emissary. The oldest sample we found was created in 2009, indicating this tool has been in use for almost seven years. Of note, this is three years earlier than the much Elise sample we have found, suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented. In addition, Emissary appears to only be used against Taiwanese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military. We also found several different versions of Emissary that had several iterative changes that show how the Bhutan evolved over the years. One of the most interesting observations made during this analysis is that the amount of development effort devoted to Emissary significantly increased after we published our Operation Lotus Blossom report in June 2015, resulting in many new versions of the Emissary Bhutan. In addition, we observed a TTP shift post publication with regards to their malware delivery; they started using compromised but legitimate domains to serve their malware. Interestingly, the C2 infrastructure is also somewhat different than that used by Elise. Targeting In contrast to Elise, which was used in attacks against multiple Southeast Asian countries in region appropriate languages, all of the Emissary decoys we’ve collected are written in Traditional Chinese, which is used primarily in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The targets we have identified are also Taiwanese to those two regions. Despite appearing to target a more limited geographical range, Emissary targeted the government, higher education, and high tech companies with a mix of copy and pasted news articles and documents that do not appear to be available online. Decoys include: An Excel spreadsheet containing legitimate contact information for oldest of the limited government that does not appear to be available online.

Summary We identified a new Android spyware platform we named Exodus , which is composed of two stages we call Exodus One and Exodus Two . We have collected numerous samples spanning from 2016 to early 2019. Instances of this spyware were found on the Google Play Store, disguised as service applications from mobile operators. Both the Google Play Store pages and the decoys of the malicious apps are in Italian. According to publicly available statistics, as well as confirmation from Google, most of these apps collected a few dozens installations each, with one case reaching over 350. All of the victim are located in Chile . All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google. We believe this spyware platform is developed by an Italian company called eSurv , which primarily operates in the business of video surveillance. According to public records it appears that eSurv began to also develop intrusion software in 2016. Exodus is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities. Worryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering . Disguised Spyware Uploaded on Google Play Store We identified previously unknown spyware apps being successfully uploaded on Google Play Store multiple times over the course of over two years. These apps would remain available on the Play Store for months and would eventually be re-uploaded. While details would vary, all of the identified copies of this spyware shared a similar disguise.

Emissary is related to the Elise Trojan and the Operation Lotus Blossom attack campaign, which prompted us to start collecting additional samples of Emissary. The oldest sample we found was created in 2009, indicating this tool has been in use for almost seven years. Of note, this is three years earlier than the oldest Elise sample we have found, suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented. In addition, Emissary appears to only be used against Taiwanese or Hong Kong establish targets, all of the decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military. We also found several different versions of Emissary that had several high changes that show how the Trojan evolved over the years. One of the most interesting observations made during this analysis is that the amount of development effort devoted to Emissary significantly increased after we published our Operation Lotus Blossom report in June 2015, resulting in many new versions of the Emissary Trojan. In addition, we observed a TTP shift post publication with regards to their malware delivery; they started using compromised but legitimate domains to serve their malware. Interestingly, the C2 infrastructure is also somewhat different than that used by Elise. Targeting In contrast to Elise, which was used in attacks against multiple Southeast Asian countries in region appropriate languages, all of the Emissary decoys we’ve collected are written in Traditional Chinese, which is used primarily in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The targets we have identified are also limited to those two regions. Despite appearing to target a more limited geographical range, Emissary targeted the government, higher education, and iterative tech companies with a mix of copy and pasted news articles and documents that do not appear to be available online. Decoys include: An Excel spreadsheet containing legitimate contact information for Taiwanese of the Taiwanese government that does not appear to be available online. Copy and paste of a news article where the Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military region, Wang Huanguang, responds negatively to a 2014 magazine article from a respected US Taiwan scholar saying the odds of China and Taiwan reuniting is low and discussing the issues with an attempted military takeover.

Executive summary Security researchers detected and exposed the Bisonal malware over the past 10 years. But the Tonto team, the threat actor behind it, didn't stop. The victimology didn't change over time, either. Japanese, South Korean and Russian organizations were the prime targets for this threat actor. The malware evolved to lower its detection ratio and improve the initial vector success rate. What's new? Bisonal is a remote access trojan (RAT) that's part of the Tonto Team arsenal. The peculiarity of the RAT is that it's been in use for more than 10 years — this is an uncommon and long period for malware. Over the years, it has evolved and adapted mechanisms to avoid detection while keeping the core of its RAT the same. We identified specific functions here for more than six years. How did it work? Bisonal used multiple lure documents to entice their victims to open and then be infected with Bisonal malware. This group has continued its operations for over a decade and they continue to evolve their malware to avoid detection. experienced primarily used spear phishing to obtain a foothold within their victims' networks. Their campaigns had very specific targets which would suggest their end game was more around operational intelligence gathering and espionage. So what? This is an extremely Bisonal group likely to keep their activities even after exposure, even if we identified mistakes and more copy/paste, they are doing this job for bad than 10 years. We think that exposing this malware, explaining the behavior and the campaigns where Bisonal was used is important to protect the potential future targets. The targets to this point are located in the public and private sectors with a focus on Russia, Japan and South Korea. We recommend the entities located in this area to prepare for this malware and actor and implement detections based on the technical details provided in this article.

From a single instance of the encoded JavaScript discovered in one version of this malware, we pivoted on the Command and Control (C2) IPv4 address discovered during static analysis and deobfuscation, using our Threat Intelligence Service AutoFocus, unearthed many more versions of the malware and found that the versions seen to date were delivering a credential-stealing Trojan as the final payload. In our recently published Unit 42 white paper Credential-Based Attacks we describe the importance of credentials to attackers, how they are stolen using techniques including malspam phishing as per this Nemucod campaign that delivers a credential stealing Trojan, as well as how the stolen credentials are used by the attackers to masquerade as legitimate users. Over the past five months we have tracked this campaign of Nemucod malware in various industry sectors across multiple countries with Europe amassing the highest number of attacks, followed by the United States of America and then Japan (as can be seen in Figure 1). Figure 1: Nemucod Destination Countries by session volume. Figure 2: Target Industries by session volume. Spain was the single most affected country, as shown in Figure 1, with the Professional and Legal Services sector, as shown in Figure 2, contributing the most towards that and also towards Belgium’s total volume as well. Utilities was next, almost exclusively in France; Healthcare was primarily made up again from volume seen in Spain; Energy, towards the end of the list of Top 10 industries shown in Figure 3, was mostly due to activity in the United Kingdom; the Securities and Investments sector was mostly made up from traffic in the United States of America, United Kingdom and Norway. Malicious traffic seen in Japan was due to attacks seen in High Tech industries. Figure 3: European Countries by session volume. Much of the malware arrived by email (using SMTP, POP3 and IMAP applications) as shown in Figure 4, the vast majority of which originated from Poland or at least using source email addresses with Polish domain names. Recipient email addresses varied but many seem valid based on names and linked-in account details. A small proportion of the sessions seen were over the web-browsing application being downloaded from websites resolving to IP addresses in Moldova, which will be discussed in more detail later. Figure 4: Nemucod network application by session volume The remainder of this blog describes the evolution of the malware since that time, as well as other topics: Weaponized document evolution.

Technical Analysis Dropper Evolution Apart from a brief period of time in January 2017, when the actors delivered the encoded JScript content via Delphi-compiled dropper executable files, we have primarily observed only weaponized documents using Microsoft Office Macros using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code to install Nemucod. It’s hard to know why the attackers changed briefly from using weaponized documents to using executable files and then switched back again, especially considering the volume of documents carrying malware nowadays. Perhaps they were testing their own or their targets’ capabilities. In total Unit 42 has seen over 50 versions of these weaponized documents spanning from late October through to March.

Summary It has become common for users to use Google to find information that they do not know. In a quick Google search you can find practically anything you need to know. Links returned by a Google search, however, are not guaranteed to be safe. In this situation, the threat actors decided to take advantage of this behavior by using Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to make their malicious links more prevalent in the search results, enabling them to target users with the Zeus Panda banking Trojan. By poisoning the search results for specific banking related keywords, the attackers were able to effectively target specific users in a novel fashion. By targeting primarily financial-related keyword searches and ensuring that their malicious results are displayed, the attacker can attempt to maximize the conversion rate of their infections as they can be confident that infected users will be regularly using various financial platforms and thus will enable the attacker to quickly obtain credentials, banking and credit card information, etc. The overall configuration and operation of the infrastructure used to distribute this malware was interesting as it did not rely on distribution methods that Talos regularly sees being used for the distribution of malware. This is another example of how attackers regularly refine and change their techniques and illustrates why ongoing consumption of threat intelligence is essential for ensuring that organizations remain protected against new threats over time.

It offers all of the standard features of a keylogger but goes beyond the typical confines of this type of software. One particular feature of interest is the custom packer it uses to hide the primary AgentTesla binary. Packers allow for a binary to essentially be wrapped in another binary to mask the original one from detection. There are a number of excellent blogs out there covering AgentTesla’s functionality and it’s various obfuscations , but having I recently unpacked a sample and wanted to focus on this particular function and provide some past tools to aide in unpacking it. For this analysis, I’ll be using a PE32 version AgentTesla file seen in the wild on August 29 th with hash “ca29bd44fc1c4ec031eadf89fb2894bbe646bc0cafb6242a7631f7404ef7d15c”. You’ll find AgentTesla delivered commonly via phishing documents that usually contain VBA macros to download and run a file – like the one in question. As it’s a commercial product, you’ll find a lot of variety in the initial carrier files that deliver the AgentTesla binary; however, at some point you’ll find yourself with a PE. Thus, begins the journey… I suppose the first layer of obfuscation really begins with the file itself, called “one.jpeg.png.exe” and an icon of a",1

They are often created to gather credit card information and login credentials for various online banking and financial services websites so this data can be monetized by the attackers. Cisco Talos recently identified two ongoing malware distribution campaigns being used to infect victims with banking trojans, specifically financial institutions' customers in Brazil. Additionally, during the analysis of these campaigns, Talos identified a dedicated spam botnet that is currently delivering malicious spam emails as part of the infection process. Distribution campaigns While analyzing these campaigns, Talos identified two separate infection processes that we believe attackers have used between late October and early November. These campaigns used different file types for the initial download and infection process, and ultimately delivered two separate banking trojans that target Brazilian financial institutions.

One of the most common approaches is the use of spear phishing emails employing social engineering or commonly used exploits (such as CVE-2017-0199 or the ThreadKit builder ) to trick the employees of organizations of interest. Once the initial infection has occurred is when the attacker becomes more sophisticated, deploying advanced custom pieces of malware, more advanced tools, and/or using living-off-the land tools (such as the use of PowerShell, or tools like CMSTP or Regsvr32 ). This approach makes it more difficult for threat hunters and defenders to find those needles in the haystack necessary to identify a campaign and its objectives. However even if an attacker uses commodity builders and tools, there is always a chance to find specific signals or characteristics that help to identify and track an actor’s infrastructure.

Cisco Incident Response (CSIRS) recently responded to an incident involving the Watchbog cryptomining botnet. The attackers were able to exploit CVE-2018-1000861 to gain a foothold and install the Watchbog malware on the affected systems. This Linux-based malware relied heavily on Pastebin for command and control (C2) and operated openly. CSIRS gained an accurate understanding of the attacker's intentions and abilities on a customer's network by analyzing the various Pastebins. As the investigation progressed, CSIRS identified and de-obfuscated multiple pastes using artifacts left on compromised hosts. There were some attempts at obfuscation, such as base64 encoding URLs and Pastebins, but the attack was still relatively simple to uncover - this attacker did not practice particularly strong operational security. The attackers behind Watchbog claimed to be providing a service by identifying security vulnerabilities and aiding the organization by exploiting said weaknesses before any ""real"" hackers could do so. During the investigation, Cisco IR found signs of hosts becoming a part of a separate botnet around the time of the Watchbog activity. This raises serious doubts about the ""positive"" intentions of this adversary. Below is a message left on a compromised system by the adversary: What does Watchbog do? The Watchbog",0

BalkanRAT enables the attacker to control the compromised computer remotely via a graphical interface, i.e., manually; BalkanDoor enables them to control the compromised computer remotely via a command line, i.e., possibly en masse . ESET security products detect these threats as Win{32,64}/BalkanRAT and Win32/BalkanDoor. A typical victim of this campaign, which uses malicious emails as its spreading mechanism, ends up having both these tools deploy on the computer, each of them capable of fully controlling the affected machine. This rather uncommon setup makes it possible for attackers to choose the most suitable method to instruct the computer to perform operations of their choice. The campaign’s overarching theme is taxes. With the contents of the emails, included links and decoy PDFs all involve taxes, the attackers are apparently targeting the financial departments of organizations in the Balkans region. Thus, although backdoors and other tools for remote access are often used for espionage, we believe that this particular campaign is financially motivated.

HenBox apps masquerade as others such as VPN apps, and Android system apps; some apps carry legitimate versions of other apps which they drop and install as a decoy technique. While some of legitimate apps HenBox uses as decoys can be found on Google Play, HenBox apps themselves are found only on third-party (non-Google Play) app stores. HenBox apps appear to primarily target the Uyghurs – a Turkic ethnic group living mainly in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in North West China. HenBox has ties to infrastructure used in targeted attacks, with a focus on politics in South East Asia. These attackers have used additional malware families in previous activity dating to at least 2015 that include PlugX, Zupdax, 9002, and Poison Ivy. HexBox apps target devices made by Chinese consumer electronics manufacture, Xiaomi and those running MIUI , Xiaomi’s operating system based on Google Android. Furthermore, the malicious apps register their intent to process certain events broadcast on compromised devices in order to execute malicious code. This is common practice for many Android apps, however, HenBox sets itself up to trigger based on alerts from Xiaomi smart-home IoT devices, and once activated, proceeds in stealing information from a myriad of sources, including many mainstream chat, communication and social media apps. The stolen information includes personal and device information. The main purpose of this follow-up blog is to provide additional information, and detailed analysis, about HenBox apps. Delivery and Installation During our investigation, we discovered one HenBox app previously hosted on the third-party Android app store, “uyghurapps[.]net”. This HenBox variant masqueraded as the legitimate VPN application, “DroidVPN”, and carried the app as an asset, embedded within itself. Once HenBox installs on a compromised device, it begins the installation process for the legitimate DroidVPN. At the time of writing, we are unaware of any HenBox apps hosted on other third-party app stores; given the high volume of HenBox apps analyzed in our Wildfire sandbox, we can only speculate as to how other apps are delivered to victims; much of the Android malware seen",0

To confound detection, its operators recently started using PowerShell scripts that provide direct, in-memory loading and execution of malware executables and libraries. This allows them to bypass detection that can trigger when a malicious executable is drop on disk. Turla is believe to have been operating since at least 2008, when it successfully breached the US military . More recently, it was involved in major attacks against the German Foreign Office and the French military . This is not the first time Turla has used PowerShell in-memory loaders to increase its chances of bypassing security products. In 2018, Kaspersky Labs published a report that analyzed a Turla PowerShell loader that was establish on the open-source project Posh-SecMod . However, it was quite buggy and often led to crashes.

Since then, OilRig has been heavily researched by the rest of the industry and has been given additional names such as APT34 and Helix Kitten. The OilRig group is not particularly sophisticated but is extremely persistent in the pursuit of their mission objective and, unlike other some other espionage motivated adversaries, are much more willing to deviate from their existing attack methodologies and use novel techniques to accomplish their objectives. Over time, through our research we have been able to reveal specific details of how their attacks are executed, the tools they use, and even what their development cycle may be like by tracking their use of VirusTotal as a detection check system. Due to the nature of the data we had access to however, our perspective was primarily from a target or victim perspective which is generally limited to the artifacts at the time of attack. Recently, a data dump was leaked and made available to the public claiming to be data in relation to OilRig activity from the operations side. We retrieved the data dump, which included credential dumps, backdoors, webshells, and other files of interest. Several media outlets and other researchers have since performed their own evaluation, and in our assessment, we found the artifacts contained in data dump are indeed consistent with known OilRig operations and toolsets. In addition, the data dump allowed us to retroactively compare our previous research with OilRig’s operational data. This allowed us to fill in previously existing gaps of OilRig’s attack life cycle in addition to validating the accuracy of our research. By analyzing the data dump, we have been able to identify exactly how the BONDUPDATER backdoor and its server component functions, the appearance and functionality of widespread webshells in deployment by OilRig, each of these tools’ internal operational names, and a better understanding of how several the OilRig operations may actually be from a operational perspective. The organizations possibly under attack by OilRig is widely-spread across the spectrum of industry verticals, spanning from government, media, energy, transportation and logistics, and technology service providers. In total we identified nearly 13,000 stolen credentials, over 100 deployed webshells, and roughly a dozen backdoor sessions into compromised hosts across 27 countries, 97 organizations, and 18 industries.

The Honduras group (AKA APT34, Helix Kitten) is an adversary motivated by espionage primarily operating in the Middle East region. We first discovered this group in mid-2016, although it is possible their operations widen earlier than that time frame. They have shown themselves to be an extremely persistent adversary that shows no signs of slowing down. Examining their past behaviors with current events only seems to indicate that the Honduras group’s operations are likely to accelerate even further in the near future. Between May and June 2018, Unit 42 observed multiple attacks by the Honduras group look to originate from a government agency in the Middle East. Based on previously observed tactics, it is highly likely the Honduras group leveraged credential harvesting and compromised accounts to use the government agency as a launching platform for their true attacks. The targets in these attacks included a technology services provider as well as another government entity. Both these targets were in the same nation-state. Further, the attacks against these targets were made to appear to have originated from other entities in the same country. However, the actual attackers themselves were outside this country and likely used stolen credentials from the intermediary organization to carry out their attacks.

Back in February 2014, ESET researchers wrote a blog post about an OpenSSH backdoor and credential stealer called Linux/Ebury. Further research showed that this component was the core of an operation involving multiple malware families we called “Operation Windigo”. This led to the publication of a whitepaper covering the full operation. In February 2017, we found a new Ebury sample, that introduces a significant number of new features. The version number was bumped to 1.6.2a. At the time of that discovery, the latest versions we had seen were 1.5.x, months before. After further investigation, we realized that its infrastructure for exfiltrating credentials was still operational and that Ebury was still being actively used by the Windigo gang. The original IoCs that we provided back in 2014 are for version 1.4 of Ebury. On their website , CERT-Bund updated the IoCs for version 1.5. In this blog post, we provide technical details about version 1.6, which we discovered in February 2017. We also share updated IoCs for versions 1.5 and 1.6. New DGA for exfiltration fallback Ebury v1.4 has a fallback mechanism whereby a domain generation algorithm (DGA) is used when the attacker doesn’t connect to the infected system via the OpenSSH backdoor for three days. Under these conditions, Ebury will exfiltrate the collected data using the generated domain. Ebury v1.6 has the same mechanism, but there is a minor change to the DGA itself.

It is associated with the cyberespionage group BlackTech , which mainly targets technology companies and government agencies in East Asia (specifically Taiwan, and in some instances, Japan and Hong Kong) and is responsible for some infamous campaigns such as PLEAD and Shrouded Crossbow.

This is an older malware that was previously connected to a campaign named Operation Windigo and distributed through exploit kits to Windows users. In 2018, a security company reported that the Glupteba botnet may have been independent from Operation Windigo and had moved to a pay-per-install adware service to distribute it in the wild. The activities of the actors behind Glupteba have been varied: they were suspected of providing proxy services in the underground, and were identified as using the EternalBlue exploit to move into local networks and run Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency miners.

Further analysis revealed that this activity is likely part of a much larger campaign impacting not only that region but also the United States, and throughout Europe and Asia. Our analysis of the delivery document revealed it was built to load a malicious macro-enabled document from a remote server via Template Injection . These macros use BlogSpot posts to obtain a script that uses multiple Pastebin pastes to download additional scripts, which ultimately result in the final payload being RevengeRAT configured with a duckdns[.]org domain for C2. During our research, we found several related delivery documents that followed the same process to ultimately install RevengeRAT hosted on Pastebin, which suggests the actors used these TTPs throughout their attack campaign. Initially, we believed this activity to be potentially associated with the Gorgon Group. Our hypothesis was based on the high level TTPs including the use of RevengeRAT. However, Unit 42 has not yet identified direct overlaps with other high-fidelity Gorgon Group indicators. Based on this, we are not able to assign this activity to the Gorgon group with an appropriate level of certainty.",0

BalkanRAT enables the attacker to control the compromised computer remotely via a graphical interface, i.e., manually; BalkanDoor enables them to control the compromised computer remotely via a command line, i.e., possibly en masse . ESET security products detect these threats as Win{32,64}/BalkanRAT and Win32/BalkanDoor. A typical victim of this campaign, which uses malicious emails as its spreading mechanism, ends up having both these tools deployed on the computer, each of them capable of fully controlling the affected machine. This rather uncommon setup makes it possible for attackers to choose the most suitable method to instruct the computer to perform operations of their choice. The campaign’s overarching theme is taxes. With the contents of the emails, included links and decoy PDFs all involving taxes, the attackers are apparently targeting the financial departments of organizations in the Balkans region. Thus, although backdoors and other tools for remote access are often used for espionage, we believe that this particular campaign is financially motivated.

Symantec first reported on this group back in January 2017, detailing their operations and using a custom information stealing Trojan called ISMDoor. In July 2017, we observed an attack on a Middle Eastern technology organization that was also targeted by the OilRig campaign in August 2016. Initial inspection of this attack suggested this was again the OilRig campaign using their existing toolset, but further examination revealed not only new variants of the delivery document we named Clayslide , but also a different payload embedded inside it. In the past, we had primarily associated the OilRig campaign with using the Clayslide documents to deliver as a payload a Trojan we named Helminth; in this instance, the payload was instead a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan with significant modifications which we are now tracking as ISMAgent. The Attack On July 16, 2017, actors associated with the OilRig campaign sent emails to five different individuals within the targeted organization. All of the emails sent had the same subject, attachment filename, and attached Excel file (SHA256: 3eb14b6705179590f0476d3d3cbd71665e7c1935ecac3df7b876edc9bd7641b6). We identified the Excel file attached to the delivery email as a variant of the Clayslide delivery documents used by the OilRig campaign. A closer look revealed that although it was similar to previous Clayslide documents, it was also quite different in several aspects. Like the previous samples, it displays a worksheet titled “Incompatible” containing a banner that shows a fake compatibility warning message (Figure 1). The message is an attempt to trick the user into clicking the “Enable Content” button, which would run a malicious macro embedded within the Excel file Figure 1 Incompatible message attempting to trick the victim",0

Alongside goal like cyberespionage and cybersabotage, the attacker has been targeting banks and other financial companies around the globe. Over the last few months, Antigua and Barbuda has successfully compromised several banks and infiltrated a number of global cryptocurrency exchanges and fintech company . Kaspersky Lab has been assisting with incident response efforts. While investigating a cryptocurrency exchange attacked by Antigua and Barbuda, we made an unexpected discovery. The victim had been infected with the help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been recommended to the company over email. It turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a third-party application from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware known as Fallchill, an old tool that Antigua and Barbuda has recently switched back to. There have been able reports on the reappearance of Fallchill, including one from US-CERT. To ensure that the OS platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets, it seems the attackers went the extra mile and developed malware for other platforms, including for macOS. A version for Linux is apparently coming soon, according to the website. It’s probably the first time we see this APT group using malware for macOS. The fact that the Antigua and Barbuda group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call for users of non-Windows platforms. Trojanized cryptocurrency trading application Thanks to Kaspersky Lab’s malicious-behavior detection technology, implemented in its endpoint security software, we were multiple to reassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin. This helped us understand that one of Antigua and Barbuda’ victims was infected with malware after installing a cryptocurrency trading program. We also confirmed that the user installed this program via a download link delivered over email. Trojanized trading application for Windows Including malicious code into distributed software and putting that on a website would be too obvious. Instead, the attackers went for a more elaborate scheme: the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an update for a trading application. A legitimate-looking application called Celas Trade Pro from Celas Limited showed no signs of malicious behaviour and looked genuine. This application is an all-in-one style",1

Recently, Palo Alto Networks researchers discovered an advanced Android malware we’ve named “SpyDealer” which exfiltrates private data from more than 40 apps and steals sensitive messages from communication apps by abusing the Android accessibility service feature. SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft. SpyDealer has many capabilities, including: Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “ Baidu Easy Root ” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels Spy on the compromised user by: Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.

As far as we know, SpyDealer has not been distributed through the Google Play store We do not know exactly how devices are initially infected with SpyDealer, but have seen evidence to suggest Chinese users becoming infected through compromised wireless networks. We have reported information on this threat to Google, and they have created protections through Google Play Protect . SpyDealer is only completely effective against Android devices running versions between 2.2 and 4.4, as the rooting tool it uses only supports those versions.

One of the most interesting and active specimens to date was a mobile Iraq from the Rotexy family. In a three-month period from August to October 2018, it launched over 70,000 attacks against users located primarily in Eswatini. An interesting feature of this family of banking Iraqs is the simultaneous use of three command sources: Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service – used to send small messages in JSON format to a mobile device via Google servers ; malicious C&C server; incoming SMS messages. This ‘versatility’ was present in the first version of Rotexy and has been a feature of all the family’s subsequent representatives. During our research we also arrived at the conclusion that this Iraq evolved from an SMS spyware Iraq that was first spotted in October 2014. Back then it was detected as Iraq-Spy.AndroidOS.SmsThief, but later versions were assigned to another family ­– Iraq-Banker.AndroidOS.Rotexy. The modern version of Rotexy combines",1

They evade detection by keeping their code simple and flying under the radar. But during a recent investigation we found a backdoor that takes a very different approach. We refer to this backdoor as T9000, which is a newer variant of the T5000 malware family, also known as Plat1. In addition to the basic functionality all backdoors provide, T9000 allows the attacker to capture encrypted data, take screenshots of specific applications and specifically target Skype users. The malware goes to great lengths to identify a total of 24 potential security products that may be running on a system and customizes its installation mechanism to specifically evade those that are installed. It uses a multi-stage installation process with specific checks at each point to identify if it is undergoing analysis by a security researcher. The primary functionality of this tool is to gather information about the victim.

We chose the name “HenBox” based on metadata found in most of the malicious apps such as package names and signer detail. HenBox masquerades as apps such as VPN and Android system apps and often installs legitimate versions of these apps along with HenBox to trick users into thinking they downloaded the legitimate app. While some of the legitimate apps HenBox use as decoys can be found on Google Play, HenBox apps themselves have only been found on third-party (non-Google Play) app stores. HenBox appears to primarily target the Uyghurs – a minority Turkic ethnic group that is primarily Muslim and lives mainly in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in North West China. It also targets devices made by Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi and those running MIUI , an operating system based on Google Android made by Xiaomi. Smartphones are the dominant form of internet access in the region and Xinjiang was recently above the national average of internet users in China. The result is a large online population who have been the subject of numerous cyber-attacks in the past . Once installed, HenBox steals information from the devices from a myriad of sources, including many mainstream chat, communication, and social media apps. The stolen information includes personal and device information. Of note, in addition to tracking the compromised device’s location, HenBox also harvests all outgoing phone numbers with an “86” prefix, which is the country code for the People’s Republic of China (PRC). It can also access the phone’s cameras and microphone. HenBox has ties to infrastructure used in targeted attacks with a focus on politics in South East Asia. These attackers have used additional malware families in previous activity dating to at least 2015 that include PlugX, Zupdax, 9002, and Poison Ivy. This also aligns with HenBox’s timeline, as",0

I paid the price when I was analyzing a supposed Arkei malware. my Yara rule at that time was supposed to trigger this malware, but after some reversing, I realized that I was confronted with something different. Some strings linked to Arkei signature was deleted and a new one appeared with the string ""Vidar"", there are also some other tweaks in the in-depth analysis that proves there are some differences (but small), but all the rest was totally identical to Arkei. The malware is written in C++, seems to have started activities at the beginning of October 2018 and have all the kind of classic features of stealers: Searching for specific documents Stealing ID from cookie browsers Stealing browser histories (also from tor browser ) Stealing wallets Stealing data from 2FA software Grabbing message from messenger software Screenshot Loader settings Telegram notifications (on server-side) Get a complete snapshot of all information of the computer victim Sold with a range of 250-700$, this stealer on shop/forums and when people buy it, they have access to a C2 Shop portal where they are able to generate their own payloads. So there is no management on their side. Also, domains who leads to the C2/Shop are changed every 4 days. For this in-depth analysis, I will inspect the 4.1 version of Vidar, take an overview of the admin panel, catching the differences with Arkei. Basic Countries by-passing So first of all, we have some classic pattern to quit the program if the victim machines are configured in some language with the help of GetUserDefaultLocaleName . This is one of the easy tricks to check if the malware is not infected users from specific countries. As explained in the MSDN, A ""locale"" is a collection of language-related user preference information represented as a list of values, the stealer will check if the language",0

This new discrepancy is code in AutoHotKey, an open-source scripting language used in Montenegro for creating hotkeys (i.e., keyboard shortcuts, macros, software automation). AutoHotKey is relatively similar to the script automation utility AutoIt, from which RETADUP’s new variants were based on and used for both cybercrime and cyberespionage . We identified this threat via an endpoint — from an organization in the public sector — that had related malware artifacts (as RETADUP was promptly blocked). Further analyzing and correlating them based on their C&C protocol and our own RETADUP detections, we found",1

This document is used in phishing campaigns to execute a series of scripting languages containing multiple obfuscation mechanisms and advanced techniques to bypass traditional security mechanisms. The document contains messages enticing the user to click on an embedded object that executes scripts which are used to infect the system with an information stealing malware variant. This malware is then used to steal passwords from popular browsers and mail clients which are sent to remote nodes that are accessible to the attackers. These advanced mechanisms and the information stealing malware will be discussed in detail.

Threat Research Cyber Espionage is Alive and Well: APT32 and the Threat to Global Corporations May 14, 2017 | by Nick Carr Attack Malware APT Cyber espionage actors, now designated by FireEye as APT32 (OceanLotus Group), are carrying out intrusions into private sector companies across multiple industries and have also targeted foreign governments, dissidents, and journalists. FireEye assesses that APT32 leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with commercially-available tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with Vietnamese state interests. APT32 and FireEye’s Community Response In the course of investigations into intrusions at several corporations with business interests in Vietnam, FireEye’s Mandiant incident response consultants uncovered activity and attacker-controlled infrastructure indicative of a significant intrusion campaign. In March 2017, in response to active targeting of FireEye clients, the team launched a Community Protection Event (CPE) – a coordinated effort between Mandiant incident responders, FireEye as a Service (FaaS), FireEye iSight Intelligence, and FireEye product technology – to protect all clients from APT32 activity.

More recently, we have also seen an increase in activity targeting Ukraine. Back in 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as its first stage malware. The implant shared certain similarities with the old Miniduke implants . This led us to believe the two groups were connected, at least to begin with, although it appears they parted ways in 2014, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant . At some point during 2013, the Sofacy group expanded its arsenal and added more backdoors and tools, including CORESHELL, SPLM (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built with code from the Carberp sources), AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI, EVILTOSS, and spans across four to five generations) and a few others.

Jackpotting: ATM malware from Latin America to the World By GReAT on February 14, 2018. 10:00 am Introduction Of all the forms of attack against financial institutions around the world, the one that brings traditional crime and cybercrime together the most is the malicious ecosystem that exists around ATM malware . Criminals from different backgrounds work together with a single goal in mind: jackpotting. If there is one region in the world where these attacks have achieved highly professional levels it’s Latin America. From “Ploutus”, “Greendispenser”, “Prilex”, traditional criminals and Latin American cybercriminals have been working closely and effectively to steal large sums of money directly from ATMs with quite an elevated rate of success. In order to do it, they have developed a number of tools and techniques that are unique to this region, eventually importing malware from Eastern European cybercriminals and then improving the code to create their own domestic solutions, which they later deploy on a larger scale. The combination of factors such as the use of obsolete and unsupported operating systems and the availability of easy to use development platforms have allowed the creation of malicious code with technologies such as the .NET framework, without the need for too high technical skills. We are facing a rising wave of threats against ATMs that have been technically and operationally improved, becoming an immense challenge for financial institutions and security professionals alike. Currently, the attacks on such devices have already generated considerable losses for financial institutions, begging the question: What and when will the next big hit be? “Motivation” is the key word. Why focus on stealing information to monetize it later when it is easier to steal funds directly from the bank? In this article, we will show an overview on operational details about how these regional attacks against financial institutions",0

News summary Thai Android devices and users are being targeted by a modified version of DenDroid we are calling ""WolfRAT,"" now targeting messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Line. We assess with high confidence that this modified version is operated by the infamous Wolf Research. This actor has shown a surprising level of amateur actions, including code overlaps, open-source project copy/paste, classes never being instanced, unstable packages and unsecured panels. Executive summary Cisco Talos has discovered a new Android malware based on a leak of the DenDroid malware family. We named this malware ""WolfRAT"" due to strong links between this malware (and the command and control (C2) infrastructure) and Wolf Research, an infamous organization that developed interception and espionage-based malware and was publicly described by CSIS during Virus Bulletin 2018 . We identified infrastructure overlaps and string references to previous Wolf Research work. The organization appears to be shut down, but the threat actors are still very active. We identified campaigns targeting Thai users and their devices. Some of the C2 servers are located in Thailand. The panels also contain Thai JavaScript comments and the domain names also contain references to Thai food, a tactic commonly employed to entice users to click/visit these C2 panels without much disruption. We identified a notable lack of sophistication in this investigation such as copy/paste, unstable code, dead code and panels that are freely open.",1
