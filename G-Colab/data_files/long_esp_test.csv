The idea behind sextortion is simple – an email demanding blackmail payment is sent to a victim, threatening to expose sexual video and private data related to the recipient if payment is not received. You may have received such emails or know others who have. Here’s another disturbing thought: is it possible that this morning you yourself unknowingly distributed 15,000 sextortion emails?

We have dubbed these new operations “Phantom in the [Command] Shell”. In these engagements, the attack begins when a victim is enticed into following a link to a file hosted on a well known, widely-used cloud provider - unaware that email filters are unlikely to block the domain, and the provider will trust their own links enough that a scan is unlikely. Once engaged, the victim’s device downloads a compressed folder that contains trojanized files. This is a user-initiated infection; meant to appear as a typical business interaction, in this case part of “Know Your Customer” banking procedures. These trojanized files use images of credit cards, driver’s licenses, passports, and utility bills. When the files are opened, the decoy images are displayed to the user, while an agent written in headless Javascript is surreptitiously invoked.

In this post we describe the technical details about a newly observed campaign of the notorious Crypt0l0cker (aka TorrentLocker or Teerac) ransomware. Crypt0l0cker has gone through a long evolution, the adversaries are updating and improving the malware on a regular basis. Several indicators inside the samples we have analysed point to a new major version of the malware. We have already seen large campaigns targeting Europe and other parts of the world in 2014 and 2015. It seems to be that the actors behind these campaigns are back now and launching again massive spam attacks. This post will also give you insights about the level of sophistication this malware has reached. Cisco customers who have Cisco AMP configured to submit samples, allowed us to identify attempted attacks on their end users. We used that as an initial starting point for our investigations. A Nullsoft Installer based executable was used in an attempt to compromise the victim hosts. The adversaries were using the Nullsoft Installer to execute a malicious DLL which starts the unpacking process of the ransomware payload. This is a similar behavior, as seen in the previous version, which was distributed two weeks before this campaign. The attackers were also using the Nullsoft Installer to execute a malicious unpacking DLL. In that case it was called Cavalry.dll (and other names). Both Cavalry.dll and Incognito.dll are",0

Executive Summary Over the past several months, Cisco Talos has been monitoring various malware distribution campaigns leveraging the malware loader Brushaloader to deliver malware payloads to systems. Brushaloader is currently characterized by the use of various scripting elements, such as PowerShell, to minimize the number of artifacts left on infected systems. Brushaloader also leverages a combination of VBScript and PowerShell to create a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that allows persistent command execution on infected systems. Brushaloader is an evolving threat that is being actively developed and refined over time as attackers identify areas of improvement and add additional functionality. We have identified multiple iterations of this threat since mid-2018. Most of the malware distribution activity that we observe associated with Brushaloader leverages malicious email campaigns targeting specific geographic regions to distribute various malware payloads, primarily Danabot. Danabot has already been described in detail here and here , so this post will focus on the analysis of Brushaloader itself. Talos has recently identified a marked increase in the quantity of malware distribution activity associated with Brushaloader, as well as the implementation of various techniques and evasive functionality that has resulted in significantly lower detection rates, as well as sandbox evasion. The advanced command-line auditing and reporting available within ThreatGrid make analyzing threats such as Brushaloader much more efficient. Threats such as Brushaloader demonstrate the importance of ensuring that PowerShell logging is enabled and configured on endpoints in most corporate environments. History of Brushaloader The first Brushaloader campaign that caught our attention was back in August 2018. It was initially notable because it was only using Polish language emails targeting Polish victims. Although it is common to see threats target users in multiple languages, attackers typically don't target a single European country. Below is a sample of one of the emails from that initial campaign and shows the characteristics that we would come to expect from Brushaloader: a RAR attachment containing a Visual Basic script that results in a Brushaloader infection ending in the eventual download and execution",0

NEWS SUMMARY We are used to ransomware attacks and big game hunting making the headlines, but there is an undercurrent of other attack types that allow attackers to monetize their efforts in a less intrusive way. Here, we discuss a multi-pronged cyber criminal attack using a number of techniques that should alert blue team members with appropriate monitoring capability but are not immediately obvious to end-users. These threats demonstrate several techniques of the MITRE ATT&CK framework , most notably T1089 (Disabling Security Tools), T1105 (Remote File Copy), T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information), T1086 (PowerShell), T1202 (Indirect Command Execution), T1055 (Process Injection), T1064 (Scripting), T1053 (Scheduled Task) and T1011 (Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium) Attackers are constantly reinventing ways of monetizing their tools. Cisco Talos recently discovered a complex campaign with several different executable payloads, all focused on providing financial benefits for the attacker in a slightly different way. The first payload is a Monero cryptocurrency miner based on XMRigCC, and the second is a trojan that monitors the clipboard and replaces its content. There's also a variant of the infamous AZORult information-stealing malware, a variant of Remcos remote access tool and, finally, the DarkVNC backdoor trojan. What's new? Embedding an executable downloader in an ISO image file is a relatively new method of delivery for AZORult. It's also unusual to see attackers using multiple methods to make money. How did it work? The infection chain starts with a ZIP file, which contains an ISO disk image file. When the user opens the ISO file, a disk image containing an executable loader is mounted. When the loader is launched, it deobfuscates malicious code which downloads the first obfuscated PowerShell loader stage that kickstarts the overall infection, disables security tools and Windows",0

The way Heatstroke’s operators do research on their potential victims is notable. They aim for their victim’s private email addresses, which they most likely collected from the victim’s own address list, which also includes managers and employees in the technology industry. Private email addresses are more likely to be hosted on free email services with lax security and spam filtering.

Attackers used Arabic language decoy documents related to current events within the Palestine Territories as lures to entice victims to open and subsequently be infected by the malware. There is data indicating that these attacks are targeting individuals or organizations within the Palestinian Territories, which is detailed later. The attacks themselves are deployed via four different means, two involving malicious RTF files, one involving self-extracting Windows executables, and the final using RAR archives. The ultimate payload is a new malware family that we have dubbed “Scote” based on strings we found within the malware samples. Scote provides backdoor access for an attacker and we have observed it collecting command and control (C2) information from Pastebin links as well as Google+ profiles. The bit.ly links obscured the C2 URLs so victims could not evaluate the legitimacy of the final site prior to clicking it. We are calling their recent activity the “TopHat” campaign. Additionally, we tracked the apparent author testing their malware against numerous security products. Our tracking of this testing enabled us to both note changes made over time as well as to observe other malware being submitted by the author.

While not previously publicly documented, the variant has been in the wild since at least 2014. There are three primary differences between it and older Bisonal malware including a different cipher and encryption for C2 communication, and a large rewrite of the code for both network communication and maintaining persistence. To date, we have only collected 14 samples of this variant, indicating it may be sparingly used. The adversary behind these attacks lured the targets into launching the Microsoft Windows executable malware by masquerading it as a PDF file (using a fake PDF icon) and reusing publicly available data for the decoy PDF file’s contents. Attacks using Bisonal have been blogged about in the past. In 2013, both COSEINC and FireEye revealed",0

It targets organizations in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, leveling its attacks on public sector agencies and telecommunications and other high-technology industries. In 2016 , for instance, we found their campaigns attacking Japanese organizations with various malware tools, notably the Elirks backdoor. Blackgear’s operators are well-organized, developing their own tools, which we observed to have been recently fine-tuned, based on their latest attacks.

This malware was first seen on April 4, 2018, with a second variant emerging on April 10. While the first version only stole browser credentials and cookies, along with all text files it can find on the system, the second variant added the ability to collect Telegram's desktop cache and key files, as well as login information for the video game storefront Steam. Talos intelligence research allowed the identification of the author behind this malware with high confidence. The author posted several YouTube videos with instructions on how to use the Telegram collected files to hijack Telegram sessions and how to package it for distribution. The operators of this malware use several pcloud.com hardcoded accounts to store the exfiltrated information. This information is not encrypted, which means that anyone with access to these credentials will have access to the exfiltrated information. The malware is mainly targeting Russian-speaking victims, and is intentionally avoiding IP addresses related with anonymizer services.

This is done to stay at least one step ahead of the attackers, and improve our advanced analytics technology to detect their artistic evasive techniques. In this blog I explain some of the core methods an attack tool named Ursnif uses, as well as mention some, probably unintentional, pieces of code that were left behind in the production version of the malware. Ursnif is a data stealer and a downloader with a lot of abilities to steal data from installed browsers and other applications (such as Microsoft Outlook). Image: https://www.microsoft.com (Win32/Ursnif) In addition to stealing data, Ursnif also has the ability to download additional malicious components from the attacker’s Command & Control (C&C) servers and load them dynamically into memory. In this version of Ursnif I have also encountered an internal peer-to-peer communication which could possibly add the ability for the sample to communicate with other Ursnif peers over the same network. We will discuss the peer-to-peer part in a future blog post. It All Begins With An Executable When the Ursnif executable is first loaded, it will unpack the real payload. The real payload is packed by the attackers, because it helps keeping it undetected by security solutions which are based on a file signature. After the real payload is unpacked, it will run in a hollowed process, and even at that stage of unpacking, the . BSS section is still obfuscated and will be de-xored on runtime before the malware will continue with the execution. The bss section before and after dexoring it Afterward, there is a simple check the malware authors left behind. If the file C:\321.txt exists, the checks for a virtualized environment are ignored.

FormBook is an inexpensive stealer available as ""malware as a service."" This means an attacker can purchase a compiled piece of malware based on their desired parameters. This is commonplace with crimeware and stealer type malware such as FormBook. It is able to record keystrokes, steal passwords (stored locally and in web forms) and can take screenshots. The author put a lot of effort in the infection vector using multiple malicious documents in a single phishing email. The author also mixed different file formats (PDF and Microsoft Office document) and used two public Microsoft Office exploits (CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882) in order to drop the final payload on the targeted system.

However, this is only a small part of this botnet’s malicious activity. Capable of acting like both a computer worm and a file virus, Phorpiex is spread through exploit kits and with the help of other malware and has infected more than 1,000,000 Windows computers to date.

DustySky is a campaign which others have attributed to the Gaza Cybergang group, a group that targets government interests in the region. This report shares our researchers’ analysis of the attack and Remote Access Tool (RAT). We also discovered during our research that the RAT Server used by this attacker is itself vulnerable to remote attack, a double-edged sword for these attackers. Attack The initial infection vector in this attack is not clear, but it results in installing the “Downeks” downloader, which in turn infects the victim computer with the “Quasar” RAT. Downeks uses third party websites to determine the external IP of the victim machine, possibly to determine victim location with GeoIP. It also drops decoy documents in an attempt to camouflage the attack. Quasar is a .NET Framework-based open-source RAT. The attackers invested significant effort in attempting to hide the tool by changing the source code of the RAT and the RAT server, and by using an obfuscator and packer. Detection Unit 42 researchers observed the Quasar RAT being prevented from executing on a Traps-protected client in September 2016. We observed these Quasar samples: File Name: f-secure.exe SHA256: 99a7cb43fb2898810956b6137d803c8f97651e23f9f13e91887f188749bd5e8f Note: connects to hnoor.newphoneapp[.]com File Name: HD_Audio.exe SHA256: 0c4aa50c95c990d5c5c55345626155b87625986881a2c066ce032af6871c426a Note: connects to manual.newphoneapp[.]com File Name: HD_Audio.exe SHA256: 86bd78b4c8c94c046d927fb29ae0b944bf2a8513a378b51b3977b77e59a52806 Note: crashes upon execution File Name: sim.exe SHA256: 723108103ccb4c166ad9cdff350de6a898489f1dac7eeab23c52cd48b9256a42 Note: connects to hnoor.newphoneapp[.]com Further research found other Quasar examples, an attack earlier in the month 2016 on the same target: SHA256: 1ac624aaf6bbc2e3b966182888411f92797bd30b6fcce9f8a97648e64f13506f We found the same Quasar code in an additional attack on the same day, but upon a different target.

The main reason it caught my attention was due to a fairly unique obfuscation technique it was employing for its PowerShell segments which I haven’t seen utilized in other tools yet. When tracking this technique, I saw an uptick in usage of PowerStager for in-the-wild attacks around December 2017. I’ll cover how the tool works briefly and then touch on some of the attacks and artifacts that can be observed. PowerStager Overview At its core, PowerStager is a Python script that generates Windows executables using C source code and then, utilizing multiple layers of obfuscation, launches PowerShell scripts with the end goal of executing a shellcode payload. There are quite a few configuration options for PowerStager which gives it a fair amount of flexibility. Below are a some of the listed configuration options from the code: Ability to choose target platform (x86 or x64) Ability to use additional obfuscation on top of defaults Ability to display customized error messages/executable icon for social engineering Ability to utilize Meterpreter or other built-in shellcode payloads Ability to fetch remote payloads or embed them into the executable Ability to escalate privileges using UAC For the samples I’ll be covering, the general flow is laid out in the following image.

The campaigns primarily targeted financial services organizations in the United States, though targeting is likely more widespread than those we’ve initially observed in our FireEye product telemetry. At least one campaign targeted South Korean organizations, including a marketing agency. In these campaigns, the phishing documents appeared to be carefully crafted and leveraged some publicly-documented — but in our experience uncommon and misunderstood — TTPs, likely in an effort to decrease detection of the malicious documents’ macros. The actor also used a self-hosted email marketing solution across multiple campaigns. Notably, the payload delivered in these campaigns leveraged a packer previously affiliated with a commonly-tracked threat actor, an overlap that we will explore later. This blog post will review the theme of these campaigns and their targets, the adversary’s unique tradecraft, the MINEBRIDGE C++ backdoor, some potential attribution overlaps, and importantly — the threat actor’s love of rap music. Targeting and Lure Detail While we first identified MINEBRIDGE samples in December, we observed our first phishing campaigns relating to this activity in early January 2020.
